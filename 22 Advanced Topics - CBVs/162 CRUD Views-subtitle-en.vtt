00:05.260 --> 00:10.310
Hello everyone and welcome to this final lecture we're going to be discussing credit.

00:10.340 --> 00:14.810
Now you may have heard of this term credit before in web development but what does it actually mean

00:15.230 --> 00:17.390
contrary to what you might think it means.

00:17.390 --> 00:24.770
It really stands for create retrieve update and delete and this process of creating retrieving updating

00:24.770 --> 00:27.640
and leading is inherent to almost every Web site.

00:27.830 --> 00:33.830
Pretty much any web site with users has the ability for a user or an administrator to create content

00:34.100 --> 00:39.020
retrieve prior content update that content or delete that content.

00:39.020 --> 00:44.180
Now we pretty much already know how to retrieve things by using the connection between the Urals the

00:44.180 --> 00:46.390
models and the views the PI file.

00:46.580 --> 00:51.530
But we're going to be learning about here is more on creating updating and deleting information from

00:51.530 --> 00:52.780
our web application.

00:54.410 --> 00:59.630
Whenever you work of models and databases you'll need to perform those four basic actions and luckily

00:59.870 --> 01:03.880
Django has class based views to simplify this entire process for you.

01:05.170 --> 01:08.610
We'll start off by exploring how to use the Create view class.

01:08.710 --> 01:14.230
Now a quick note while we are using this create view class in the programming section of this lecture

01:14.590 --> 01:20.070
we will purposefully induce a few errors to clarify where certain variable names are coming from.

01:20.110 --> 01:22.600
So I'm not making mistakes as I'm coding along.

01:22.720 --> 01:27.340
I will actually be inducing those errors on purpose and I'll remind you of that as we continue programming

01:28.780 --> 01:33.550
once we've worked through the create a view class working with the update view and delete the classes

01:33.550 --> 01:36.270
will be very straightforward.

01:36.460 --> 01:40.570
In other quick note there's going to be a lot of interaction between your Urals not pi.

01:40.690 --> 01:44.850
The used up high end models not pi file as well as all your template files.

01:44.920 --> 01:50.320
If you ever get stuck on an error I want you to triple check that your code has matching the notes exactly.

01:50.340 --> 01:54.880
Or is matching what I've shown you here in the video lecture.

01:54.990 --> 01:59.460
The nature of the interaction between all the files is going to make it almost impossible for me to

01:59.460 --> 02:01.420
give you good help on this topic.

02:01.500 --> 02:02.860
In the Q&amp;A forums.

02:03.000 --> 02:05.680
So if you ever get stuck on anything and you're really stuck.

02:05.730 --> 02:09.040
Make sure that you're actually following along with the video Exactly.

02:09.060 --> 02:13.160
Or just go ahead and download the associated files for this lecture.

02:13.170 --> 02:14.520
All right let's get started.

02:14.520 --> 02:16.540
Hop over to the Adam text editor.

02:16.830 --> 02:22.730
OK here I am at the Adam text editor and over on the right I also have a browser open to the page so

02:22.730 --> 02:25.490
you've been working with throughout this entire section of the course.

02:25.560 --> 02:30.480
I have the home page and we learned how to connect templates and also inject content into this home

02:30.480 --> 02:31.090
page.

02:31.140 --> 02:36.240
I can click on schools see a list of all the schools select first school and then come to the school

02:36.240 --> 02:40.550
detail page and then I can always click on admin to go to the admin page as well.

02:40.770 --> 02:44.760
Let's go back to schools and we'll see a list of schools here.

02:44.760 --> 02:50.850
The first thing I want to do is show you how we could possibly create a new school using create you

02:51.330 --> 02:52.150
in order to do that.

02:52.200 --> 02:59.550
Let's hop over to our views that py file under basic app and I'm going to create a new class that as

02:59.580 --> 03:04.420
you may have guessed is going to be called School create view.

03:04.560 --> 03:06.940
So I will collapse this directory for a second.

03:07.090 --> 03:11.750
And before we actually get started with this let's import the views we're going to be using.

03:11.970 --> 03:15.270
Right now we're importing a view template view list view.

03:15.360 --> 03:20.510
Now what I can do is put these in multiple lines is have some parentheses here.

03:20.730 --> 03:24.550
And anything wrapped inside is print seis and then go on multiple lines.

03:24.550 --> 03:29.110
So when importing view template view list view detail view we're already familiar those.

03:29.280 --> 03:40.240
And then I'm also going to be importing create view update view and then delete view.

03:40.600 --> 03:45.550
And basically what these views are going to do and help us out with is create you will help us create

03:45.790 --> 03:51.140
new additions to our models update is going to take an existing entry in your model and a light update

03:51.140 --> 03:55.260
it and then delete view will take something that exists there and delete it.

03:55.510 --> 04:00.010
So let's start off with create a view which is going to allow us to essentially create a new school

04:00.130 --> 04:01.410
easily.

04:01.670 --> 04:06.220
I will scroll down over here and underneath school detail to you.

04:06.500 --> 04:16.480
I will say something like class school create view and then we'll just pass and create view will inherit

04:16.510 --> 04:17.310
from that.

04:17.740 --> 04:26.720
And then what I'm going to do under the Create view is I will say model is equal to models dot school

04:27.920 --> 04:32.540
and then I will save that and whenever we creative you want to make sure that it's linked to some sort

04:32.540 --> 04:33.730
of your l.

04:33.800 --> 04:40.010
So I'll bring back my directory tree and come over to the Urals PI file of my actual application and

04:40.010 --> 04:43.400
I'm going to add another line there for you.

04:43.730 --> 04:46.680
So let's actually edit this a little bit.

04:46.730 --> 04:51.800
Right now I have this sort of regular expression and I going to simplify this instead of having this

04:51.800 --> 04:52.590
in brackets here.

04:52.610 --> 04:55.450
Let's just make the say digit plus.

04:55.580 --> 05:00.150
And basically what this is doing is taking the primary key of the school as the display.

05:00.200 --> 05:03.210
And what I want to do is create a new york Airlink here

05:06.250 --> 05:13.350
and this will take in as a regular expression just create forward slash dollar sign.

05:13.350 --> 05:19.920
So what this says is if someone goes to the domain page slash basic app slash create it's going to allow

05:19.920 --> 05:31.370
us to create a new school and here we'll save views dot school create view dot as View member we have

05:31.370 --> 05:36.560
to do that for class based views and we'll go ahead and give it a name and the name we're going to give

05:36.560 --> 05:39.590
it is just create so we can reference it later.

05:39.800 --> 05:44.500
And since they added a new item to this list I want to make sure that they're separated by commas.

05:44.850 --> 05:45.370
OK.

05:45.470 --> 05:50.210
So just to expand this a little bit so he can see this in a tiny bit more detail here.

05:50.210 --> 05:55.490
I've just added your L create views at school create as View name as create.

05:55.520 --> 06:02.130
We're going to save that and then what we're going to do is check it out over here and we will get some

06:02.130 --> 06:06.270
errors but I'm going to walk you through them so we can get a better understanding of why we're getting

06:06.270 --> 06:07.730
these errors.

06:07.850 --> 06:12.720
So I will come back to schools refresh and then I'll click on first school.

06:12.720 --> 06:14.490
It's the walk of the school detail page.

06:14.490 --> 06:14.850
All right.

06:14.880 --> 06:15.980
So far so good.

06:16.170 --> 06:25.310
I'll come back up here to where it says basic app and I'm going to try to go to create enter and note

06:25.310 --> 06:26.330
what happens here.

06:26.360 --> 06:33.500
It says improperly configured at basic app create using model for mixin based classes school create

06:33.510 --> 06:37.170
view without the fields attribute is prohibited.

06:37.440 --> 06:40.260
So that's the error I want you to learn how to read.

06:40.320 --> 06:42.260
In case you ever encounter it.

06:42.450 --> 06:48.930
So basically what this is saying is hey you want to create a view but you didn't specify what fields

06:49.170 --> 06:51.750
are prohibited and what fields are allowed.

06:51.750 --> 06:53.130
Well that's easy enough to fix.

06:53.130 --> 07:00.060
We'll come back to the used up high and over here under create just like we did back when we're working

07:00.060 --> 07:01.090
with models.

07:01.110 --> 07:06.960
We're going to find the fields that will allow a user to create.

07:07.030 --> 07:11.520
So the school had three main fields the name the principal and location.

07:11.590 --> 07:13.990
And this almost acts like a security measure.

07:14.050 --> 07:20.890
Maybe you don't want someone to edit the location of a school or the name of the school etc. we'll just

07:20.890 --> 07:22.730
pass in all the fields for now.

07:24.460 --> 07:35.010
Principal and then location and I'm going to save this and as I refreshed this page I should see probably

07:35.010 --> 07:36.820
another error.

07:36.990 --> 07:39.080
And there it is so template does not exist.

07:39.090 --> 07:43.700
Well that makes sense I never actually created a template for the school creation page.

07:43.710 --> 07:50.100
But what's interesting here is it tells you that it's looking for basic app school form.

07:50.100 --> 07:57.220
And basically what that means is that Django that create view is automatically creating a default HVM

07:57.220 --> 08:03.600
l template that it's expecting and it's expecting it to be in the format of all lowercase.

08:03.630 --> 08:04.520
The model name.

08:04.560 --> 08:09.250
In our case at school underscore and then form so let's that in.

08:09.390 --> 08:12.820
And I would always suggest that you use the defaults there.

08:13.070 --> 08:19.830
So underneath templates basic app I will create a new file and I will call it what it was looking for

08:19.830 --> 08:26.640
school underscore form that each TNL and it makes sense that we need some sort of form for the editor

08:26.880 --> 08:34.540
or user to come in and create a new school and let's show you how we can create the school form page.

08:34.560 --> 08:43.680
First things first though I want to say extends from the basic app slash and then the basic app base

08:43.680 --> 08:48.270
which was basic app underscore based but each T.M..

08:48.780 --> 08:55.260
OK so that's going to allow me to extend that template and then let's have in our body block tool called

08:55.260 --> 08:59.990
block body underscore block.

09:00.100 --> 09:05.780
And since I have a block I will say and block as well.

09:06.590 --> 09:06.930
All right.

09:06.960 --> 09:11.790
Now it's actually put some thing here and this is what the user is going to see when they actually try

09:11.790 --> 09:14.280
to create a new school.

09:14.440 --> 09:21.380
And I'm going to essentially think ahead and know that I am also going to add an update view later on.

09:21.400 --> 09:23.530
So keep that in mind as I'm working here.

09:23.530 --> 09:26.920
Usually you wouldn't just know this off the top of your head.

09:26.920 --> 09:31.670
And then this header or heading one on point to use some logic.

09:31.840 --> 09:42.660
Have an if statement and my template tagging and I will say if Knot's form the instance dot piqué and

09:42.660 --> 09:45.320
we'll explain what that means in a little bit.

09:45.480 --> 09:48.420
I will say create school

09:51.530 --> 09:56.480
and then since I know I'm also going to add an update view later on meaning update a school that already

09:56.480 --> 09:57.070
exists.

09:57.080 --> 09:58.130
I will say else

10:00.670 --> 10:11.550
update school and then since I haven't if I always need to and if so do these lines actually mean.

10:11.550 --> 10:18.150
Well basically what I'm saying is the following I am going to extend from basic app have the body block

10:18.510 --> 10:25.050
and the heading of this form page that create page is going to check if the instance of the primary

10:25.050 --> 10:27.570
key exists or not.

10:27.570 --> 10:31.260
If it does not exist that means this is a new school.

10:31.290 --> 10:33.930
Now we're going to create the school.

10:33.930 --> 10:37.650
Otherwise we're updating a school that currently exists.

10:38.460 --> 10:42.440
And this will make more sense as we actually developed the update view.

10:42.560 --> 10:45.230
Hopefully you get the basic idea that I'm checking first.

10:45.320 --> 10:48.200
There's a primary that's here that school exists.

10:48.300 --> 10:51.180
Well in that case if it doesn't exist I'm creating a school.

10:51.220 --> 10:55.120
Else if it already does exist then I'm updating the school.

10:55.240 --> 11:01.000
And then finally to actually update school we need to take in a form some information and we actually

11:01.000 --> 11:03.150
just need to specify the method is post.

11:03.160 --> 11:05.350
We don't need to have a class or action here.

11:05.350 --> 11:09.430
You could have a class with this bootstraps stuff we've been learning about but we'll keep it simple

11:09.430 --> 11:10.380
for now.

11:10.480 --> 11:18.120
As always of any form we need to have our C S R F tokin C S or of Tokin and this should be underscore

11:19.470 --> 11:19.920
tokin

11:23.410 --> 11:33.860
and then we're going to inject our form as we've seen earlier as P and then finally we'll say input.

11:34.010 --> 11:38.050
The type is going to be a submit button and let's give it a class.

11:38.060 --> 11:41.700
So it looks a little nicer since we are working a bootstrap.

11:41.720 --> 11:46.470
We'll say it's a BT and B 10 cash primary.

11:46.660 --> 11:54.290
Always nice to flex those bootstrap muscles and let's give it a value of Samit we'll save that and hopefully

11:54.290 --> 11:55.900
that worked out this error.

11:55.940 --> 12:00.680
Remember that was the school for that age T.M. and it's really important that you have the ability to

12:00.740 --> 12:06.230
read these sort of errors throughout the course we've been kind of avoiding errors to begin with but

12:06.530 --> 12:10.170
now I really want you to get familiar and be able to read oh template does not exist.

12:10.200 --> 12:13.370
Well that means I need to check out with templates expecting.

12:13.400 --> 12:18.310
All right let's refresh this and perfec we see create a school.

12:18.320 --> 12:20.710
Now let's try to actually create a school.

12:20.760 --> 12:28.940
We'll give it the name of the school my brand new school the principal will be I don't know someone

12:28.940 --> 12:34.100
named Larry and the location will say it's in.

12:34.420 --> 12:40.810
I don't know Panama will say submit and boom we have another problem.

12:40.850 --> 12:47.660
It says improperly configured at basic at underscore app create and it says has no your L to read direct

12:47.660 --> 12:50.680
to either provided your l or.

12:50.700 --> 12:57.380
And what we're going to be doing the define a get underscore absolute underscore your L method on the

12:57.380 --> 12:58.210
model.

12:58.550 --> 13:02.220
So let's follow those directions and actually do it.

13:02.400 --> 13:09.430
OK so I'm going to come over to the models and I'm going to look for school and it told me that I should

13:09.430 --> 13:15.270
define a get absolute Your L method for this model so as follows instructions.

13:15.280 --> 13:24.150
I'll say if I get absolute's underscore you are l or pasand self.

13:24.450 --> 13:31.500
And then we're going to do is basically reverse and tell it what primary key we want this school to

13:31.500 --> 13:33.250
be created with.

13:33.260 --> 13:40.080
So here it is actually import reverse from your resolvers which we have seen before.

13:40.370 --> 13:46.240
Say from Jingo that Corda you are l resolvers.

13:46.540 --> 13:57.750
Import loops reverse and that means I can use it down here where I will just return reverse and what

13:57.750 --> 14:05.590
I am going to do here is called Basic underscore app the detail view not the detail viewers and the

14:05.590 --> 14:09.860
importing but the actual detail and the views that py file.

14:10.040 --> 14:17.360
And then we need to add some keyword arguments as a parameter and the keyword argument in past here

14:17.600 --> 14:29.040
is Piquet for primary key and the value for that is just self-taught P.K..

14:29.100 --> 14:30.850
So let's save that.

14:30.870 --> 14:35.410
And again learning how to kind of read and roll the punches on some of these error codes so it does

14:35.420 --> 14:36.780
get absolutely oral method.

14:36.780 --> 14:38.160
We did that already.

14:38.160 --> 14:40.140
Let's refresh this.

14:40.140 --> 14:41.660
It may ask us to continue.

14:41.700 --> 14:42.680
That's fine.

14:42.990 --> 14:46.680
Says Walk to School detail page school details my brand new school.

14:46.680 --> 14:48.340
Larry in Panama.

14:48.600 --> 14:50.460
So what was actually going on here.

14:50.700 --> 14:56.510
Basically what happened is after we created that view we never told Django where it should go to.

14:56.520 --> 15:02.640
We never said oh go do something after you created the view which is why Gyngell was requesting for

15:02.640 --> 15:04.430
a get absolute Your L.

15:04.560 --> 15:11.010
And basically what we said is OK go back and reverse and figure out that you should go to the detail

15:11.010 --> 15:15.300
page or whatever the primary key is of the school you just made.

15:15.300 --> 15:20.850
In our case this is basic app for your number maybe different however and that's the very basics of

15:21.300 --> 15:22.500
having a create view.

15:22.500 --> 15:28.010
So if I go back to the list of schools I can see I have my brand new school in my brand new school.

15:28.230 --> 15:33.480
So the reason it's inserted twice here is because we basically did it twice while we were kind of fixing

15:33.480 --> 15:34.790
some of those errors.

15:34.860 --> 15:37.840
But don't worry we'll fix that when we learn how to delete views.

15:38.040 --> 15:41.030
But first let's learn how to work with up few.

15:41.370 --> 15:46.200
And a lot of the work is actually have already been done for us since we did a lot of stuff we were

15:46.200 --> 15:48.060
doing the Create view.

15:48.060 --> 15:50.930
So school of the view should actually be quite simple as well.

15:51.180 --> 16:02.160
Let's come over to views that pi and I will create a new class called school up view.

16:02.410 --> 16:04.330
And I would recommend that you name your classes.

16:04.330 --> 16:10.180
Basically the way I'm doing it with the model name and then create your view or detail view etc. and

16:10.180 --> 16:13.540
then I'm going to inherit from up the view.

16:13.570 --> 16:15.280
And this one's quite simple.

16:15.280 --> 16:19.500
Again we're going to specify what fields we want to be updated.

16:19.510 --> 16:24.610
Now this is where maybe you can think about OK who's going to be updating this.

16:24.610 --> 16:30.090
What kind of user permissions will they have and also what makes sense for updating a school.

16:30.190 --> 16:32.740
Does it make sense to up the school's principal.

16:32.740 --> 16:33.800
Well yeah that makes sense.

16:33.800 --> 16:37.390
Principals can change because it makes sense to update the school's name.

16:37.450 --> 16:38.200
Maybe.

16:38.350 --> 16:39.640
What about the location of school.

16:39.640 --> 16:45.590
Well probably not schools usually don't move around that much so let's just say you can only update

16:45.610 --> 16:48.170
the name and the principal of a school.

16:49.390 --> 16:53.960
Obviously your own situations are going to be unique and you'll have to make that call.

16:54.220 --> 16:59.460
And what we're going to do here is once we have this we'll just connected to the model will say models

16:59.470 --> 17:03.660
equal to models thought and in our case it's the school model.

17:03.670 --> 17:10.740
We'll save this and then we're going to do is come back to your Allsopp pie and actually set up a your

17:10.820 --> 17:19.490
L for our updating inside this your PI file for application 1 I'm going to do is copy this detail view

17:20.760 --> 17:26.870
paste that again and this is basically the same view I want except I want to clarify some sort of update

17:26.870 --> 17:27.960
extension.

17:28.310 --> 17:34.250
So basically if I go to basic underscore app slash up they slash and then the number of the primary

17:34.250 --> 17:35.550
key of the school.

17:35.550 --> 17:42.220
It will let me update that school so I need to change this from detail view to update view as View.

17:42.560 --> 17:45.800
And then it will change the name to detail.

17:46.840 --> 17:55.080
To update and then let me save that and the next thing we have to do is actually edit the HTML file

17:55.080 --> 17:58.820
or the template file that relates the school detail page.

17:58.830 --> 18:06.010
So let's hop over to that and right now this is our detail page and it just says for the information

18:06.010 --> 18:09.630
of school to students etc. and what we will do.

18:10.620 --> 18:18.120
Is outside of this fact let's put it outside this div but before the end block I'll create a new div

18:18.780 --> 18:20.610
inside its own container.

18:20.980 --> 18:29.730
It'll just be a paragraph with an anchor tag inside of it and this will be your template and this will

18:29.730 --> 18:40.410
be a template that takes you to the basic underscore app was the name of the and will pass in an argument.

18:41.150 --> 18:52.420
P.K. school underscore detail that Piquet and let's actually give this a class so it looks a little

18:52.420 --> 18:53.080
nicer.

18:54.130 --> 19:02.310
Will say this is class of her bootstrap we can say between will give it warning you give it success

19:02.310 --> 19:05.410
whatever you want but maybe awarning makes sense to update something.

19:05.400 --> 19:10.850
It's kind of a yellow hue by original nature and then we actually want to have some sort of texture

19:10.860 --> 19:12.940
that tells you what you're going to update this.

19:12.960 --> 19:17.300
All right let's save this and will refresh this page and see what happens.

19:19.180 --> 19:24.400
So now if I scroll down a little bit I see this update button and we can always zoom out so it's a little

19:24.400 --> 19:25.210
more clear.

19:25.210 --> 19:28.060
So now on the detail page I can see the update button.

19:28.090 --> 19:30.930
You may have to scroll down depending on how zoomed in you are.

19:31.030 --> 19:36.940
If I click on it I get the form and the option to update the school and only the fields that I specify

19:37.240 --> 19:38.850
the name and principal.

19:38.860 --> 19:41.580
So let's try to change the name of the school.

19:41.590 --> 19:50.190
Actually this is change the principal to something really obvious like Mr. obvious I should be really

19:50.190 --> 19:55.190
obvious change will submit it and it takes back to that school's detail page.

19:55.320 --> 20:01.620
That's what we were working with when we said here on the ref your L basic app update and then Piquet's

20:01.620 --> 20:02.680
school detail.

20:02.710 --> 20:03.450
OK.

20:03.600 --> 20:08.020
That allows us to link whatever school we're actually updating with.

20:08.050 --> 20:12.040
So what the school page I can see now for school has principal Mr Obvious.

20:12.040 --> 20:17.740
And if I come back to schools click on for school I can see that that change has been permanently done

20:18.280 --> 20:19.010
great.

20:19.150 --> 20:22.920
So now you learn how to create views and how to update views.

20:22.930 --> 20:26.470
The last thing they need to do is figure out how we can delete views.

20:26.470 --> 20:33.280
So let's go back to our actual editor our bringing back my directory tree and what I'm going to do is

20:33.280 --> 20:43.430
come over here to the views up high and we'll create our last and final view which is the school Dilley

20:43.580 --> 20:51.340
view we'll have delete view here and this is going to be slightly different from everything we've done

20:51.340 --> 20:52.420
so far.

20:52.510 --> 20:56.450
As far as updating and creating views that it's actually not so bad.

20:58.150 --> 21:02.070
First we have to do is say model is equal to models.

21:02.170 --> 21:06.860
School connect the models that makes sense as far as what we're going to delete.

21:07.000 --> 21:14.260
And then the next thing I have to add in is a success your L variable or attribute I should say because

21:14.260 --> 21:18.720
this is a class so will create an attribute called success.

21:18.720 --> 21:25.080
Underscore your L and what we're going to do is use the reverse underscore lazy function.

21:25.140 --> 21:28.560
So I need to go up and import that and I'll explain what it is.

21:28.560 --> 21:36.280
Right after I import it we'll say from jingo dot core dot.

21:36.370 --> 21:42.870
You are all resolvers and it's actually from the same place we imported reverse from so we can import

21:42.870 --> 21:47.560
reverse or reverse underscore lazy.

21:47.710 --> 21:52.540
And if you're familiar of programming you may have heard of the term lazily evaluated and what we're

21:52.540 --> 21:57.820
going to do is all the way down here and it's actually telling us we need to still finish that off where

21:57.820 --> 22:07.200
it says success you IRL we will call reverse underscore lazy and passen that we want to go to the basic

22:07.200 --> 22:10.560
app and the list view.

22:10.560 --> 22:13.990
So what does success means is all right.

22:14.100 --> 22:20.100
Once you successfully deleted a school I want you to go back to the list page of the basic app and show

22:20.100 --> 22:24.870
all the schools and theoretically once you're done deleting that school should no longer be on that

22:24.870 --> 22:25.890
list.

22:25.890 --> 22:32.210
The reason we use reverse lazy is that we don't want this evaluated completely when running our PI file.

22:32.250 --> 22:36.380
We only wanted to wait until it's actually called as a success.

22:36.600 --> 22:40.830
And as with all the other views we've been working with we need to go ahead and add a Oreilles that

22:40.830 --> 22:44.120
PI that actually matches with this particular view.

22:44.190 --> 22:49.530
So we'll come back here to your Elle's that pie and let me collapses to see a little more room.

22:49.620 --> 22:52.370
And again this is going to look really similar to update.

22:52.500 --> 22:57.830
Instead of updating something though we're going to be deleting it so we'll hit enter and I'm going

22:57.830 --> 23:01.730
to change this name from Update to delete.

23:02.150 --> 23:07.340
I'll change this update to daily as well.

23:07.410 --> 23:10.530
And then here it says update will change that to delete.

23:10.800 --> 23:16.170
So I should be able to go to basic app slash delete and then any primary key and start getting some

23:16.170 --> 23:18.370
options for deleting stuff.

23:18.630 --> 23:22.860
But in order to do that I should have some sort of HTL file.

23:23.100 --> 23:26.500
So will go ahead and go with the default H-2 him Al file that's expected.

23:26.500 --> 23:27.600
We'll add it in right now.

23:27.600 --> 23:29.630
We don't see those errors anymore.

23:30.060 --> 23:39.200
Now all we do is we say school underscore confirm underscore delete that H Tim L and this is going to

23:39.200 --> 23:41.300
be the page that's actually shown.

23:41.390 --> 23:45.440
When someone tries to manually delete something from the database

23:48.380 --> 23:58.260
we'll say extends and we're going to go from the basic slash basic app underscore based studies Tim

23:58.260 --> 23:59.620
Ehle file that I have here

24:03.140 --> 24:05.060
and the start our block

24:08.720 --> 24:12.010
will have our body block.

24:12.180 --> 24:14.250
Now if any block we need to and the block

24:19.330 --> 24:27.060
and where we're going to have here is basically just says H-1 and we'll say delete and it will automatically

24:27.060 --> 24:33.360
pass in a context object called school or whatever the lowercase version of your model is.

24:33.360 --> 24:37.680
Remember we previously covered how to create your own context object names.

24:37.740 --> 24:40.950
You come back here to views and scroll up a little bit.

24:40.980 --> 24:43.700
We talked about it here context object name.

24:43.830 --> 24:49.530
The basic one for detail that I encouraged each use default is the lowercase version of your model.

24:49.530 --> 24:56.330
So we use that we expect school to be here and we're going to call off of it is the name and say questionmark.

24:56.400 --> 25:03.210
So this is going to show is a heading that says hey delete that school's name Question Mark and then

25:03.210 --> 25:05.240
we'll just have a simple form.

25:05.450 --> 25:14.760
The simple form is just going to say method is post with any form we always need a C SRF token

25:18.510 --> 25:20.100
and it's going to have an input.

25:20.100 --> 25:28.220
The input would just be submit and now it can kind of play the classes of bootstrap.

25:28.340 --> 25:32.630
And I've been waiting to use this a long time but we can finally use the danger button.

25:33.820 --> 25:38.730
We don't actually give this a name but we should give it a value that way it says something we'll just

25:38.730 --> 25:43.380
have it say delete and below this.

25:43.400 --> 25:44.440
If you don't want to delete.

25:44.450 --> 25:48.880
We should have some sort of link that goes back to cancel or at least some sort of text.

25:48.880 --> 25:52.880
You can have this be a button in other form whatever you want are you going to have it be an anchor

25:52.880 --> 25:56.090
tag with the word cancel inside of it.

25:57.640 --> 26:04.210
And for the ref will have it take us back to that school's detail page.

26:04.330 --> 26:11.800
So I have a template here that goes to basic app whatever the name of your application is detail that

26:11.800 --> 26:12.460
your URL.

26:12.520 --> 26:20.090
And then we'll say P.K. is equal to school dot primary key.

26:20.100 --> 26:25.110
So again we're grabbing the primary key off that school context object that's returned just the same

26:25.110 --> 26:32.340
way we grabbed that name because remember that detail your L if we go back to your Elle's that pie over

26:32.340 --> 26:39.270
here under the term detail we're expecting some sort of primary key to be inserted which is why we then

26:39.270 --> 26:43.820
having to pass it in as an argument in these HTL template files.

26:44.220 --> 26:52.160
Ok so let's save this and we'll refresh our schools page and let's go ahead and try to delete school

26:52.190 --> 26:54.970
number four because I have a duplicate there.

26:55.340 --> 27:04.050
So up here in the your L I will say basic app deletes forward slash for enter and it says delete my

27:04.050 --> 27:05.190
brand new school.

27:05.320 --> 27:10.410
And I can see here we can click Cancel which is going to take us back to that detail page of that particular

27:10.410 --> 27:13.410
school or I can hit delete so.

27:13.830 --> 27:14.580
We'll hit delete.

27:14.670 --> 27:16.290
And there you go.

27:16.380 --> 27:17.940
That school has now been deleted.

27:17.940 --> 27:20.190
Let's try one more time make sure it's actually working.

27:20.310 --> 27:25.710
Try and that other brand new school and we actually need to enter this manually later on you can add

27:25.710 --> 27:26.900
links if you want.

27:26.910 --> 27:33.270
Obviously you should be very careful adding delete links all over the place the here and delete slash

27:33.270 --> 27:36.450
3 delete my brain new school and we'll hit delete.

27:36.820 --> 27:37.210
OK.

27:37.230 --> 27:37.620
Perfect.

27:37.620 --> 27:38.700
That's all working.

27:38.700 --> 27:44.730
Later on we'll also learn how to use slugs instead of just primary keys where slugs are essentially

27:44.790 --> 27:49.680
the name of objects lower lowercase with dashes in between any spaces.

27:49.680 --> 27:53.220
And if you're familiar for development at all you've probably heard that term before.

27:53.550 --> 27:54.120
OK.

27:54.270 --> 28:00.150
I hope you enjoyed learning about updating creating and deleting views and I hope that this makes your

28:00.150 --> 28:05.090
life a lot easier as you find yourself programming of larger projects and Django.

28:05.160 --> 28:07.470
You're going to be using those views all the time.

28:07.560 --> 28:11.940
And that's basically the whole point of Django to make your life a little easier as you try to focus

28:11.940 --> 28:14.950
on what's really important developing your own web site.

28:14.970 --> 28:16.650
Thanks and I'll see it the next lecture.
