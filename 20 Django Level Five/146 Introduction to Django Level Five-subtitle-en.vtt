Hello everyone.

00:06.040 --> 00:11.800
To change a level 5 in this section of the course we're going to be focusing on user authentication.

00:11.820 --> 00:16.770
So far we've only created applications that assume everyone's going to see the same pages.

00:16.970 --> 00:20.870
And this is one of those aspects of Django where there are lots of built in available tools as well

00:20.870 --> 00:25.880
as plenty of external packages that enhance the functionality of user Athens cation.

00:26.180 --> 00:30.980
We're going to be focusing mainly on the built in tools for this particular section of the course and

00:30.980 --> 00:36.950
we'll be talking about users in the user model talking about permissions groups passwords and authentication

00:37.130 --> 00:41.650
and then how to have users log in and log out of your Web site OK.

00:41.670 --> 00:42.630
Let's get started.

00:42.630 --> 00:43.560
I'll see you at the next lecture.
