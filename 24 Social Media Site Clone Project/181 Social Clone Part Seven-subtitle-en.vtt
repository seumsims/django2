00:05.460 --> 00:10.980
Welcome everyone to part seven of the social club project what we're not going to do is focus on the

00:10.980 --> 00:15.630
group's application by creating the views for the group templates and then connecting the template files

00:15.630 --> 00:19.680
to those views using the or stop high file for group applications.

00:19.680 --> 00:20.010
All right.

00:20.040 --> 00:23.190
Let's hop over to the Adam text editor and get started.

00:23.190 --> 00:28.600
All right so by now I should already have your model's not pi file filled out for the group's application.

00:28.680 --> 00:35.030
Now we're going to open up views up PI under groups and start filling out some very basic views for

00:35.030 --> 00:36.850
our actual group's application.

00:37.050 --> 00:39.290
And we're going to do is couple of things first.

00:39.430 --> 00:43.290
A couple of imports I will say from Django contrib.

00:43.730 --> 00:49.670
Th for authorization mix ins and then ongoing to import.

00:49.790 --> 00:56.500
And I will import two mixes here the loggin required to mix in and then the permission required mixin.

00:56.790 --> 01:00.500
And if you want you can put these on multiple lines just by having parentheses.

01:00.510 --> 01:06.570
So something that's common to see is if you have really long import lines you can just use multiple

01:06.570 --> 01:09.640
lines with a print CS there and then.

01:09.660 --> 01:15.060
Well we're also going to do is a bunch of other imports we will say from Django core that you're all

01:15.060 --> 01:25.800
resolvers import reverse and then I will also say from Django views import and then I'm going to import

01:25.800 --> 01:29.970
those generic views and that's just the class based views that we've worked with before.

01:29.970 --> 01:31.150
OK let's get started.

01:31.410 --> 01:36.830
I'm going to say class and I will have a create group view.

01:36.850 --> 01:40.600
So if someone is logged into the site and they want to create their own group kind of like creating

01:40.600 --> 01:42.970
your own subset this will be the view for that.

01:43.090 --> 01:51.350
And it's going to take and the logging required mixin and it will also take in the create view and then

01:51.350 --> 01:54.860
here I just need to specify the fields I want them to be able to create.

01:54.860 --> 01:59.630
So we say field is equal to and I want them to be able to edit the name of the field or the name of

01:59.630 --> 02:00.290
the group.

02:00.320 --> 02:05.640
I should say and then the description and those are just directly linked to the model slot pi.

02:05.660 --> 02:10.220
So the name and the description I don't want them to be able to edit things like Slogger members because

02:10.430 --> 02:11.920
that really wouldn't make sense.

02:11.960 --> 02:16.820
So when they create a group it takes a generic view and then finally I just need to connect it to the

02:16.820 --> 02:18.200
actual model.

02:18.200 --> 02:21.730
So if I'm going to connect it to the group model that means I need to import it.

02:21.830 --> 02:29.870
So we'll say from groups or models and you can also say from that models import group and then group

02:29.870 --> 02:33.300
member that way you can call them throughout these class based views.

02:33.300 --> 02:35.910
So right now we have a very basic create view.

02:36.080 --> 02:42.110
So to actually connect this to a template we're going to need to later on our template underneath groups

02:42.230 --> 02:46.970
as well as are you're also not profile but let's continue on to create a detail view and a list view

02:47.090 --> 02:49.870
and then we'll actually mess around with those template files.

02:50.090 --> 02:57.160
So I will say class and let's just say single group and this is just going to be a generic detail view.

02:57.240 --> 03:02.820
So it's just the details of that specific group things like the post inside that group etc..

03:03.120 --> 03:05.770
And that's just going to be connected to a model called group.

03:05.820 --> 03:07.710
So pretty simple.

03:07.710 --> 03:09.390
And then we'll have a list groups.

03:09.420 --> 03:14.310
So when someone goes to like the list groups page to see a list of all the available groups kind of

03:14.310 --> 03:19.710
like selecting a list all subsets or something like that and then we'll say generic and that will be

03:19.710 --> 03:24.700
a list view and you can see already that class based views making our lives a lot simpler.

03:25.140 --> 03:27.010
And then we'll say models equal to group.

03:27.030 --> 03:31.260
So I'm going to say that looks like we have three main class based views.

03:31.260 --> 03:35.930
Now let's head over to the templates and actually create those template files that connect them.

03:35.940 --> 03:39.450
We already have group base group detail group form and group list.

03:39.600 --> 03:41.350
So we should be pretty good to go.

03:41.520 --> 03:48.210
Let's start off by saying group base and in the group base that each team T.M. I'm going to say extends

03:48.690 --> 03:54.680
from base thought HVM L and then I'm going to call block content.

03:54.780 --> 03:59.250
So that's going to extend from the actual baseline each team M-file that have already created underneath

03:59.250 --> 04:00.910
the project templates.

04:01.170 --> 04:09.710
And then I have my content here and I'm going to create a div container class and then I will say div

04:09.830 --> 04:14.180
class row K.S. need that for bootstrap purposes.

04:14.300 --> 04:16.830
And then I'm going to make three blocks here.

04:16.850 --> 04:22.670
I have a pretty group block a group content block and then a post group block that we'll see how we

04:22.670 --> 04:23.800
can use later on.

04:23.810 --> 04:30.070
So this block I will say is group we can actually just put it like this.

04:30.100 --> 04:32.700
It's a little more readable than in a copy and paste this.

04:32.740 --> 04:38.530
And then we will have a block that is the group contents group underscore content and then the post

04:38.530 --> 04:39.120
group.

04:39.340 --> 04:43.840
So we won't use all of these blocks in every template but in case we ever want to have something that

04:43.840 --> 04:49.000
goes before the group content we have group during the group content we have group content and then

04:49.000 --> 04:50.720
after that group content we have post group.

04:50.950 --> 04:51.570
OK.

04:51.790 --> 04:53.830
So that's always I will say that.

04:54.250 --> 05:01.660
And then we're going to continue on with the other templates so lets start off with the group detail

05:01.660 --> 05:10.330
page that will come over as a group detail that very next template and I will say extends from groups

05:10.540 --> 05:18.010
forward slash group underscore based to h tim L that H team all we were just working with and then let's

05:18.010 --> 05:21.810
put everything we want to occur before the group name.

05:21.880 --> 05:29.060
So I will call block and this will be my Prete group block and then a heading one I'm going to have

05:29.060 --> 05:34.950
the group name and I can call that using template syntax by saying group that name.

05:35.090 --> 05:41.240
So remember with those class based views there is actually a context dictionary that gets passed that

05:41.240 --> 05:43.070
holds everything that the model has.

05:43.070 --> 05:50.450
So since groups have names I can just call group name and this word group is the lowercase singular

05:50.450 --> 05:53.480
version of the actual models become models of Pi.

05:53.540 --> 05:55.540
This is the lower case model.

05:55.610 --> 06:00.000
G r o u p which is where that actual context dictionary comes from.

06:00.050 --> 06:05.900
And that just as we've told you before comes from class based views then heading to.

06:06.160 --> 06:14.170
I'm going to say member count and hearing and input another basically call to the context dictionary

06:14.650 --> 06:18.550
and enjoy group members so again come back to the model.

06:18.550 --> 06:24.820
Remember we have members here an offer that I'm actually going to call a method and I can call the count

06:25.510 --> 06:27.490
method or attribute off of that.

06:27.530 --> 06:31.690
And if you want a list of these you can check the documentation for various things you can call off

06:31.780 --> 06:33.810
of model objects.

06:33.820 --> 06:39.190
All right now the next step for the sexual group detail page is on that group detail page where it's

06:39.190 --> 06:40.680
actually listing the posts.

06:40.690 --> 06:45.240
If you're a member and you're logged in I want you to have a leave or join button there.

06:45.250 --> 06:46.950
So let's try to add that in.

06:47.140 --> 06:53.560
Inside this same Prigg group block I'm going to create div and I will call this content in case I ever

06:53.560 --> 07:03.300
want to edit this FC the SS and inside of this I'm going to say if and I will say if user in group members

07:04.170 --> 07:14.400
all so that means if this user happens to be inside this essentially an array or list of all the members

07:14.850 --> 07:18.930
inside that actual group model then I'm going to do the following.

07:19.080 --> 07:28.200
I'll have an anchor tag that has an H ref to your L and then groups leave.

07:28.250 --> 07:34.640
So we haven't actually created this view or Uriel's yet but later on in our Urals file for the actual

07:34.640 --> 07:38.540
groups we're going to be able to have the option to leave the group.

07:38.750 --> 07:43.320
So we only want that if the user is already in the group so we'll say OK the users are already in a

07:43.320 --> 07:44.870
group and visit to this page.

07:44.870 --> 07:47.890
They have the option to leave and they're going to be able to leave.

07:47.900 --> 07:49.730
We also have to define what slug.

07:49.970 --> 07:53.810
And that's just going to be equal to group thought slug.

07:53.810 --> 07:55.160
Now we'll kind of edit this later on.

07:55.160 --> 08:00.950
But let's actually make sure to see your template with those percent signs and then inside of this we're

08:00.950 --> 08:05.270
going to go ahead and give this a class to all say class when collapses.

08:05.290 --> 08:06.890
We get a little more room here.

08:06.890 --> 08:08.050
Class is equal to.

08:08.060 --> 08:12.770
We'll just have this be a normal button say between Actually let's make it a really large button.

08:12.760 --> 08:15.570
So it's kind of obvious I can start this on a new line.

08:15.980 --> 08:22.150
So it will say class Button but say button.

08:22.220 --> 08:24.190
LG for a large button.

08:24.380 --> 08:28.160
Fill out this button and then let's make it a warning button so it's like really obvious to the user

08:28.160 --> 08:30.670
that if they click that button they're going to leave.

08:31.180 --> 08:31.590
OK.

08:31.610 --> 08:37.940
And then we're also going to do is add in a span so we're going to use Cliffie icons or glyph icons

08:38.390 --> 08:45.020
and this will allow me to actually have an icon there instead of just like a word that says Leave group.

08:45.040 --> 08:46.840
So it's going to look like an exit sign or something.

08:46.850 --> 08:51.920
So we'll have it be a remove circle and that will be right next to the word leave.

08:52.280 --> 09:01.500
So we do this by creating a span and then inside that span we create a class and that class is going

09:01.500 --> 09:12.480
to be a glyph icon and then it's glyph icon dash remove dash circle and you can technically not really

09:12.960 --> 09:13.820
have the span.

09:13.890 --> 09:15.890
Just kind of an icon I want to put in there.

09:15.950 --> 09:20.100
You can check out the bootstrap documentation for all these codes and all the different icons they have

09:20.100 --> 09:21.080
available.

09:21.510 --> 09:24.890
And then I'm going to say leave OK.

09:25.120 --> 09:30.160
So we have this button that shows up if a group if a member is already in that group and then they can

09:30.160 --> 09:34.780
click on that button and they'll leave the group so that if that user is already in the group else we

09:34.780 --> 09:37.320
should probably give them the option to join the group.

09:37.330 --> 09:37.780
So we'll say.

09:37.780 --> 09:38.890
Else.

09:39.280 --> 09:42.200
And it's going to be a really similar thing we'll have h.

09:42.490 --> 09:45.450
And then let's just copy this because it's so similar.

09:45.670 --> 09:50.730
So I'm going to copy this entire anchor tag and then post it here.

09:52.310 --> 09:56.240
And then inside this anchor tag let's change what we want so else you're not going to leave it.

09:56.250 --> 09:57.850
And we know they're going to join it.

09:58.040 --> 10:01.150
So we'll make another view later on for Euro groups join.

10:01.160 --> 10:06.110
Same thing is going to be the slug and we can have the same thing as a button a warning you can change

10:06.140 --> 10:09.460
if you want but a warning or default et cetera for coloring.

10:09.680 --> 10:15.980
We will have instead of a remove circle I'm going to say OK circle and then we will say and sort of

10:15.980 --> 10:19.260
leave.

10:19.310 --> 10:19.610
All right.

10:19.610 --> 10:20.900
Again basic idea.

10:20.900 --> 10:27.170
We check that user who's currently visiting this page is in a group that members are all and then whether

10:27.170 --> 10:29.420
or not they're going to leave or join.

10:29.420 --> 10:33.710
All right now we're actually almost done with group detail that reached him L and then scroll down past

10:33.800 --> 10:40.420
this block and then I will start a new block and this is just going to be my group content here.

10:41.210 --> 10:45.860
And then what we will do is I don't want the group content that is the list of actual posts to take

10:45.860 --> 10:46.990
up the entire page.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.590
I kind of want them lined up a little bit.

10:48.620 --> 10:55.750
So what I'm going to do is say give class and I'll get this a class of call medium Dash 8.

10:55.760 --> 11:03.050
Those are those bootstrap formations and then we'll say if I'm going to say if group that postop count

11:03.650 --> 11:05.630
is equal to zero.

11:05.870 --> 11:10.970
And that basically means if the group doesn't actually have any posts in it yet what I will say is instead

11:10.970 --> 11:17.840
of listing something I'm just going to have a hit or two that says no post in this group yet let's make

11:17.840 --> 11:19.010
sure we spell it right.

11:19.100 --> 11:20.700
So no post in this group yet.

11:21.490 --> 11:27.520
And then if we don't have else actually let's say else else what else are going to do.

11:27.520 --> 11:37.770
We're going to say for four post in group posts all and then I'm going to just cycle through this.

11:37.890 --> 11:46.180
But when I'm going to do is say include and then we'll say posts forward slash underscore post-time

11:46.260 --> 11:52.280
h tim L and let me describe since we haven't really seen include yet what's going on there and other

11:52.290 --> 11:57.060
than that we're actually done with this page so it will take a little bit of time to kind of do a little

11:57.060 --> 11:58.950
description of 13:1.

11:59.010 --> 12:05.070
So all I'm doing here is I'm saying if the group currently has no post just have a heading to that says

12:05.100 --> 12:06.310
no post in this group yet.

12:06.480 --> 12:09.650
But the more likely situation where we actually already have posts in that groups.

12:09.770 --> 12:13.180
What I want to do is save for posts in groups of posts that all.

12:13.290 --> 12:20.370
And then I'm going to include now include is kind of a way of saying extends except you're going to

12:20.370 --> 12:24.000
essentially insert it right in the middle of an each team I'll file.

12:24.150 --> 12:30.820
So instead of actually extending and using blocks we can do is use the Include statement to inject in

12:30.830 --> 12:31.960
each team Al file.

12:32.040 --> 12:35.220
Sister is going to be so much stuff going off the posts themselves.

12:35.220 --> 12:38.970
A lot of HVM calls a lot of template calls I template tags.

12:38.970 --> 12:42.240
I don't want to include all of that in this group detail that is T.M..

12:42.360 --> 12:46.680
Instead what I will do is have that all taken care of in this post.

12:46.710 --> 12:47.800
A steam elf file.

12:48.000 --> 12:53.160
And since this is going to be injected to kind of signify that as a developer I had this underscore

12:53.160 --> 12:54.200
there.

12:54.270 --> 12:56.430
Now I technically don't need that underscore there.

12:56.460 --> 13:01.050
It's really more for me to understand that this particular piece of each team file is designed to be

13:01.050 --> 13:04.190
injected into other each team of files using include.

13:04.200 --> 13:08.320
So that's the kind of syntax that I'm going to be using to actually understand that.

13:08.550 --> 13:13.500
So that's it for the group detail page and we're going to do is finish off those other class based views

13:13.890 --> 13:15.180
that we just created.

13:15.420 --> 13:20.940
So we'll come back up here the next one we're going to do is the group list page so that should be pretty

13:20.940 --> 13:21.550
straightforward.

13:21.570 --> 13:23.730
Let's go to group list.

13:23.880 --> 13:33.010
Click on that and this is going to extend from groups slash group underscore based h Timo.

13:33.010 --> 13:40.120
Let's collapse that directory tree again and then I'm going to call a block for my pre content's or

13:40.270 --> 13:49.390
group content than hear what I will say is give this a class of call medium for a lot of these class

13:49.390 --> 13:50.980
calls and you can adjust them yourself.

13:50.980 --> 13:53.350
This is more for styling.

13:53.520 --> 14:00.240
And then we will say contents and what I want to do is check if a user is logged in and they're authenticated.

14:00.240 --> 14:06.770
I want to say a welcome back username and if not it's going to just say hey welcome to the group's page.

14:06.770 --> 14:07.980
Select the group.

14:08.160 --> 14:09.690
So let's try that out.

14:09.750 --> 14:17.190
We'll see if the user is underscore authenticated and I can use all these user template calls because

14:17.280 --> 14:22.890
of the Django authorization package basically takes care of all the heavy lifting to connect this on

14:22.890 --> 14:29.780
the backend so you can just say user that is authenticated and what I will do if they're authenticated.

14:30.070 --> 14:35.660
I'll have a heading to you on the web page it says Welcome back.

14:35.680 --> 14:43.920
And inside of this heading to I'm also going to have an anchor Ted and it's going to link to their actual

14:43.950 --> 14:44.930
profile.

14:45.150 --> 14:53.490
So I'll say you are el and pose for underscore user so that it actually links to their profile where

14:53.490 --> 14:56.300
it has a list of all their posts in case they ever want to see that.

14:56.430 --> 14:59.260
And then I also need to provide their username.

14:59.580 --> 15:09.180
So say a user name as equal to user dot whoops user thought user name and then inside of here and the

15:09.180 --> 15:15.570
actual anchor tag wasn't going to do is say at end with template tags.

15:15.690 --> 15:22.430
I need to inject this double say at user the user name so that basically has that kind of Twitter quality

15:22.760 --> 15:26.900
or basically any social network quality where it is user and authenticated.

15:26.920 --> 15:28.050
I'll say welcome back.

15:28.170 --> 15:32.480
There'll be a link here that says at user that username and if you click on that link it will take you

15:32.480 --> 15:34.040
to a list of all your posts.

15:34.040 --> 15:38.410
Now we're going to take care of that view later on when we're dealing with posts now.

15:38.420 --> 15:45.290
And if so for everyone though it will show the falling ill say groups heading to.

15:45.350 --> 15:50.750
And then I'll have a paragraph here it says Welcome to the group's page.

15:50.750 --> 15:52.160
Exclamation point.

15:52.160 --> 15:57.860
Save that and then the other thing I want to do is check that if a user is authenticated I should be

15:57.860 --> 16:01.290
able to kind of have a button that says Create newgroup.

16:01.520 --> 16:02.510
So we'll do that as well.

16:02.510 --> 16:15.390
We'll say if outside of this first attack if the user is underscore authenticated it will have an anchor

16:15.390 --> 16:21.910
tag here are again the anchor tag is linked to your el groups underscore creates.

16:21.940 --> 16:23.230
And there's a couple of ways you could have done this.

16:23.230 --> 16:27.370
You don't have to do exactly the same way I'm doing it but I'm going to do it for a simple button call

16:28.090 --> 16:35.160
between PTEN dash and the between dash will be 10 dash warning.

16:35.170 --> 16:40.090
Now remember from the navigation bar technically the user can already create a group from any page.

16:40.090 --> 16:44.980
There's a little link in the navigation but since you're on the group's page it might be nice to actually

16:44.980 --> 16:47.670
have it as a separate button as well on the actual group page.

16:47.670 --> 16:49.390
So that's why I'm adding this in.

16:49.900 --> 16:57.100
And then we will go ahead and add a span and use those glyph icons so in the span I will give it the

16:57.100 --> 16:59.410
class glyph.

16:59.410 --> 17:06.970
Let me make sure I spell that right Cliff icon glyph icon.

17:07.020 --> 17:11.470
I'm in trouble with this glyph icon dash plus dash sign.

17:11.620 --> 17:16.250
It looks like a little plus sign and we'll just have the text right next it.

17:16.280 --> 17:20.920
Create new group and then we need to end that if.

17:20.990 --> 17:21.320
All right.

17:21.320 --> 17:24.790
So that's it for that at the very top of the page.

17:24.890 --> 17:28.020
And so that will end the group block.

17:28.040 --> 17:28.940
So it just checks.

17:28.940 --> 17:29.960
Welcome back.

17:29.960 --> 17:34.040
And then says welcome to girls page has a little button there if you're authenticated to create a new

17:34.040 --> 17:35.290
group.

17:35.300 --> 17:45.170
Next we're going to do the actual group or content so we'll say have a new block group content and then

17:45.280 --> 17:52.420
couldn't give this one more division we'll say should be call dash media Dash 8.

17:52.440 --> 17:59.400
So this can take up everything and then we'll say div class I'll say list group in case we ever want

17:59.400 --> 17:59.680
to.

17:59.700 --> 18:02.270
This will see SS and now I'm going to have a for loop.

18:02.280 --> 18:07.130
So I'm going to say for group an object underscore list.

18:07.170 --> 18:10.310
And we'll talk about this object in your score list later on.

18:11.280 --> 18:20.440
So for group an object list and have an anchor tag and we'll give this you or I'll call.

18:20.480 --> 18:32.430
We'll say you're all groups single where the slug is equal to the group thoughts slug itself and I'm

18:32.430 --> 18:40.530
going to have this actually have a class will say this class will be list group item in case I ever

18:40.530 --> 18:42.940
want to add it or call it.

18:43.200 --> 18:46.320
And then let's kind of start this rest this anchor tag on a new line.

18:46.530 --> 18:54.850
And that is going to have let's say inside this anchor tag will have a heading three with a class of

18:54.850 --> 18:55.910
its own.

18:56.230 --> 19:05.930
And this class will say tidal list group item heading.

19:05.930 --> 19:11.700
So in case you ever want to edit that three you can do it in the SS and then I will say the group actual

19:11.700 --> 19:15.090
name.

19:15.170 --> 19:21.360
So that's the heading three and what is actually going on here is kind of briefly describe it.

19:21.550 --> 19:28.110
So so far I have for every group in my object list which is essentially going to be a list of the actual

19:28.110 --> 19:29.530
groups remember this is the group list.

19:29.530 --> 19:30.370
Each team L.

19:30.540 --> 19:35.050
And we're going to have an anchor tag that so far has a link to the group names.

19:35.070 --> 19:40.020
If you click on the group name Ill take it to the groups single page through this slug connection but

19:40.020 --> 19:41.930
there's still more I want to add here.

19:42.320 --> 19:52.770
I'm going to inside of the same anchor to create a div class and will say list group item I'm going

19:52.770 --> 19:56.650
to call it text and then say container fluids.

19:56.670 --> 20:03.930
That's a bootstrap a container called and then here is where I'm finally going to use that description.

20:03.970 --> 20:09.420
So I'll say it description underscore HVM L and then a pipe OPERATOR I'll say safe.

20:09.430 --> 20:15.090
So that allows me if you remember from the previous clone project that allows me to actually use the

20:15.230 --> 20:21.610
HTL code in a safe way so that if something is bold you actually see bold text instead of seeing bold

20:21.700 --> 20:24.360
template tags or bold HTL tags.

20:25.640 --> 20:31.280
Now what we want to do is right after this we're going to call another div and this is just going to

20:31.280 --> 20:33.940
be a row and I know there's a lot to type here.

20:33.980 --> 20:38.030
So if you want to just copy and paste this from the actual solution so you don't make any type of thing

20:38.030 --> 20:41.240
where it's really easy to make a typo here and I'm sure I'm making one right now which we're going to

20:41.240 --> 20:50.930
fix later and we'll create one more that says call medium for and we'll create a span and we will say

20:50.990 --> 21:00.340
this is a class and we'll get this a batch class and then we're going to do here is inside the span.

21:00.660 --> 21:08.160
I'll have group members counts and then inside of that I'm going to say

21:11.030 --> 21:11.720
member

21:14.890 --> 21:26.610
member and I will say group members count pluralize and later on we'll actually see what this does pluralize

21:27.660 --> 21:34.700
SRU I don't actually spell it wrong OK that's the end of this particular div and then we're going to

21:34.700 --> 21:38.600
start one more inside of the object suite div.

21:38.620 --> 21:43.690
And this is also going to be call M.D for in here again.

21:43.720 --> 21:50.560
Basically have the same thing span with the classes equal to badge.

21:50.680 --> 22:00.650
And then we'll call it group post counts and then outside of this we will have post template tagging.

22:00.650 --> 22:07.240
I'm going to inject group post counts and then we will call pluralize on that as well.

22:08.680 --> 22:08.940
OK.

22:08.960 --> 22:14.380
So a ton of div tags here and I promise we'll go over all this at the very end.

22:14.480 --> 22:20.450
But now we're going to do is basically scroll down and this make sure everything's lined up and we should

22:20.450 --> 22:26.630
have two div tags after the end four and then an anchor and three more tags before that and everything

22:26.630 --> 22:31.460
else should be lining up so if you don't have that you probably made a typo somewhere suggest a copy

22:31.460 --> 22:32.660
and paste from the solution.

22:32.660 --> 22:34.790
That's a lot easier than typing along with me.

22:35.000 --> 22:37.160
But let's actually go through this grouplets patients.

22:37.170 --> 22:38.840
There's a lot going on here.

22:38.870 --> 22:44.060
First off group all we're doing is checking these authenticated if they are we have a little thing that

22:44.060 --> 22:48.960
says welcome back at whoever the user is and it links to that user's post.

22:49.100 --> 22:52.520
So you log in you go to the groups page says welcome back Jose.

22:52.670 --> 22:53.240
Click on that.

22:53.250 --> 22:56.060
Then it takes a list of all jose's posts.

22:56.060 --> 22:56.930
Then it says END-IF.

22:56.960 --> 22:59.310
Now everybody would say welcome to the group page.

22:59.360 --> 22:59.790
We check.

22:59.810 --> 23:03.950
OK if is authenticated let's add a little button there so they can create a new group.

23:03.950 --> 23:05.320
There's also one of the navigation bar.

23:05.330 --> 23:07.250
But we should have one here as well.

23:07.310 --> 23:09.410
That's the end of the group block.

23:09.680 --> 23:13.250
Now it's the much more complicated group content block but it's actually not so bad.

23:13.400 --> 23:17.360
Basically what we're doing is we're saying OK for every group in this object list which is going to

23:17.360 --> 23:21.290
be a list of all the group objects we're going to have.

23:21.290 --> 23:25.850
And essentially you can kind of ignore these class calls or just CSSA and focus on what's really going

23:25.850 --> 23:26.660
on here.

23:26.690 --> 23:28.590
So here we're going say group name.

23:28.700 --> 23:33.200
And you can click on that group name and will take you to the single group page for that group detail

23:33.200 --> 23:38.380
page so we just created earlier and then the actual description we call a description underscore each

23:38.430 --> 23:46.010
hymnal and we call it safe that way and caster's any bold tags or it's hallux tags whatever they happen

23:46.010 --> 23:47.570
to be displayed correctly.

23:47.840 --> 23:51.740
And then we have these group members accounts and group post count.

23:51.890 --> 23:56.210
So on the actual page where it details the groups that are available it will say how many posts that

23:56.210 --> 23:58.710
group has and how many members that group has as well.

23:58.740 --> 24:00.260
That's basically all that's going on here.

24:00.380 --> 24:04.230
It's just the large amount of div class calls that kind of make it hard to read.

24:04.310 --> 24:06.630
But essentially it's just a pretty simple for loop.

24:06.680 --> 24:08.380
That's the splaying the group name.

24:08.600 --> 24:11.450
The number of members in that group and the number of posts that group.

24:11.540 --> 24:15.210
Then when you click the group name it will take you to that actual group detail page.

24:15.210 --> 24:18.480
That's all that's going on in groups list.

24:18.500 --> 24:23.960
Now finally what I want to fill out is let's say someone does click on Create a new group they're going

24:23.960 --> 24:28.500
to go to groups create and that's going to be created by that create view.

24:28.610 --> 24:33.470
So let's come over here and set that up with group underscore forum.

24:33.530 --> 24:43.150
So in this page I'm going to say extends groups slash group underscore based T.M. and then I'm also

24:43.150 --> 24:48.950
going to remember this is a form so I will load up bootstrap 3 to make the form look nice.

24:50.940 --> 24:57.730
Then we'll have block and then it will say group underscore content and here doesn't really matter what

24:57.730 --> 24:58.660
heading size you use.

24:58.660 --> 25:07.570
I'm just going to say create a new group and then we'll create a form here will say form loops for form

25:08.410 --> 25:13.780
and this form will have a class but it will have an action and the action will link back to

25:17.060 --> 25:20.510
your L groups underscore create.

25:20.540 --> 25:27.080
So basically linking to art create view and then we'll give this post method and will actually also

25:27.080 --> 25:28.970
give it an ID in case we ever want to edit it.

25:28.990 --> 25:37.580
S. SS Now I will say group form spicket group form of camel casing just so I know and inside of here

25:37.580 --> 25:40.620
since it's a forum we always need our CSR token.

25:41.030 --> 25:43.930
And then below that we're going to have the forum call.

25:43.940 --> 25:49.820
So if template whip's with template tagging will call bootstrap form as we saw before bootstrap underscore

25:49.820 --> 25:51.560
form in the past in the form.

25:51.560 --> 25:54.530
So this makes it look a lot nicer when using bootstrap 3.

25:54.590 --> 26:01.320
Which again you have Pipp install finally will have an input block and that will just be type submit.

26:01.350 --> 26:03.220
It'll save value says create.

26:03.240 --> 26:09.810
So it says create and then let's give this a class we don't need to give it a name globally between

26:10.540 --> 26:15.190
PTEN primary and then BATNA large.

26:15.250 --> 26:18.790
OK so definitely a lot of stuff here so let's quickly review.

26:18.790 --> 26:24.080
We finished off all the templates for groups as well as most of the views so let's quickly review.

26:24.100 --> 26:29.560
So what we did in this lecture was it came over to views that pie in the group's application.

26:29.820 --> 26:34.900
And we created three main views for creating a new group for looking at a single group and then the

26:34.900 --> 26:40.210
list groups and then we actually went to the templates and fill that out ourselves so the basic template

26:40.270 --> 26:41.720
just has these three blocks.

26:41.810 --> 26:43.040
What goes before the group.

26:43.150 --> 26:44.470
What the actual group conta is.

26:44.500 --> 26:45.280
And in the post group.

26:45.310 --> 26:49.720
That way we can easily separate them than we actually have the detail page of a group which just shows

26:49.720 --> 26:50.610
the group name.

26:50.800 --> 26:56.380
The number of members in that group and then it actually says if the users in that group there's a leave

26:56.380 --> 27:00.880
button if the user is not in that group there's a join button that we can't connect users to groups

27:00.880 --> 27:01.630
themselves.

27:01.870 --> 27:06.030
And here we just say OK if there's no post in the group just say no posts.

27:06.130 --> 27:10.510
If there are post though we're just going to kind of inject this underscore postdates TMail content

27:10.810 --> 27:16.330
that will work with later on in the future lecture then we actually went to the group list page which

27:16.330 --> 27:21.190
was a little complicated but essentially just shows Welcome back through the user says Welcome to the

27:21.190 --> 27:22.190
group page.

27:22.270 --> 27:26.470
If the user is authenticated we have a little button that says you can create a new group and then here

27:26.470 --> 27:32.920
we just actually list out every group with the link to the group and then the number of members and

27:32.920 --> 27:34.360
the number of posts that group.

27:34.360 --> 27:39.640
Finally for that create the we have group underscore forum or just create group and we have that forum

27:39.640 --> 27:40.600
that we just created.

27:40.820 --> 27:41.260
OK.

27:41.440 --> 27:43.810
We're actually still not done with all the views for groups.

27:43.810 --> 27:46.260
There's two more a little more complicated views.

27:46.260 --> 27:47.750
We're gonna do the next lecture.

27:47.750 --> 27:53.800
That's basically the views for joining a group and leaving a group so that's going to kind of require

27:53.830 --> 27:57.940
a little bit more of a code to actually make those work.

27:58.060 --> 28:00.560
Or if you have any questions feel free to post the Kewney forums.

28:00.580 --> 28:05.370
Definitely that a lot here and we only type the lot so if you're stuck on something or something that

28:05.370 --> 28:08.890
didn't seem quite right you can always just copy and paste from the provided notes.

28:08.890 --> 28:11.090
Thanks everyone and I'll see at the next lecture.
