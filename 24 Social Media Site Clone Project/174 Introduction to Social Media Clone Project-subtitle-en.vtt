00:05.860 --> 00:10.960
Welcome to your next social clone project in this project we're going to be taking bits and pieces from

00:10.990 --> 00:17.560
other social sites to build our own platform and our site is basically going to be a social outer space

00:17.560 --> 00:18.710
fan community site.

00:18.730 --> 00:23.910
So people who are big fans of things that do have outer space can come here and be part of the site

00:25.170 --> 00:29.950
this clone project also takes full advantage of some of jingoes onepoint elevons newest features such

00:29.950 --> 00:33.550
as loggin view and log out view.

00:33.560 --> 00:37.730
So the basic idea of the site is that users can create groups on various topics that have to do with

00:37.760 --> 00:41.420
outer space things like Space X NASA Pluto etc..

00:41.690 --> 00:46.070
They can then create posts inside those groups and they can also leave and join other groups.

00:46.070 --> 00:48.980
Let's discuss a few of the key features.

00:49.180 --> 00:53.980
So as I mentioned there are groups in this web site similar to things like sublets except for just calling

00:53.980 --> 00:54.970
them groups.

00:54.970 --> 01:01.300
There's also multiple users and authorisations just like any social media site or a social network site.

01:01.330 --> 01:04.960
There's also posts inside the group similar to posting a tweet.

01:05.140 --> 01:08.120
We're also going to be linking user profiles with an at symbol.

01:08.290 --> 01:12.400
So if you ever see a user name somewhere there's a little symbol attached to it you can click on that

01:12.400 --> 01:14.560
symbol and then go straight to their profile.

01:14.590 --> 01:16.160
And there's also multiple applications.

01:16.180 --> 01:19.220
Unlike the previous clone project.

01:19.370 --> 01:24.320
Let's take a quick peek at the actual project and remember you can download the zip file in this lecture

01:24.320 --> 01:28.490
as a resource which has all the code that we're going to be needing for this project.

01:28.490 --> 01:32.360
Let's jump to the browser and check out the project.

01:32.360 --> 01:32.630
All right.

01:32.630 --> 01:37.790
This is what the Web site actually looks like it's called Star social and let's say it's the best community

01:37.790 --> 01:39.410
for all things on outer space.

01:39.440 --> 01:44.500
And one of the funny little features of it is with javascript and CSSA we can't create stars and let

01:44.500 --> 01:45.980
him bounce around etc..

01:46.310 --> 01:51.260
So the main idea is that we could sign up as a new user and then we get this sign up page.

01:51.260 --> 01:55.310
So we have at this plaining so we'll call this space fan.

01:55.310 --> 01:57.330
One is our display name.

01:57.470 --> 02:03.560
Give this an email address of hello at gmail and then we'll say test password and we need to confirm

02:03.560 --> 02:06.780
our password so we'll say test password.

02:06.780 --> 02:07.950
I didn't mess that up.

02:07.950 --> 02:08.520
There we go.

02:08.520 --> 02:10.030
And now let's log in.

02:10.030 --> 02:17.580
So I'll a space fan 1 and lie test password log in and it says Now I'm logged in.

02:17.580 --> 02:22.830
Go to groups saw select go to groups and I can see there's some groups already created here for me so

02:22.830 --> 02:26.490
I can create a new group and it will tell me it's create a new group.

02:26.490 --> 02:36.900
So we'll give this group something that says like NASA rocks and then we'll say people who like NASA

02:37.680 --> 02:41.010
will create that group so we can then join the group.

02:41.010 --> 02:45.950
So it has no members right now so we'll join the group and now we can see has a member count of 1.

02:45.960 --> 02:48.250
So there's no posts in this group yet.

02:48.270 --> 02:53.650
Now you notice that we have a post button a group button and a create group button will be on groups.

02:53.670 --> 02:58.770
And now you can see in the group list we have my new group Nassor rocks and then the second group so

02:58.770 --> 03:03.680
we can end up doing is posting to any of these if I click on post it allows me to do and you message

03:03.690 --> 03:13.020
so I'll say first post in NASA exclamation point and then I'll choose this Nassor rocks group hit post

03:13.500 --> 03:17.340
and then I can see here I'm not superzoom then but hopefully you can see this.

03:17.340 --> 03:22.960
I'll zoom in a little more that I have the first post in Assa space fan and I can see space fan once

03:22.980 --> 03:25.380
I had this little symbol I have the time I post it.

03:25.390 --> 03:26.630
And NASA rocks.

03:26.880 --> 03:32.310
And if I hit on a space fan 1 there is my post history at space fan 1 and it's basically since I only

03:32.310 --> 03:33.110
have one post.

03:33.180 --> 03:33.590
There it is.

03:33.600 --> 03:36.070
And I can also delete posts so I can hit delete here.

03:36.240 --> 03:37.860
It says Are you sure you want to delete this post.

03:37.860 --> 03:44.190
I can either confirm to delete or cancel it so I'll just confirm that delete etc now takes me back to

03:44.220 --> 03:47.660
just a list of all the posts currently available for me.

03:47.670 --> 03:48.850
So again it groups.

03:48.870 --> 03:51.690
I can see members I can join other groups etc..

03:51.900 --> 03:55.950
All right there's a lot to this project even though it seems pretty simple on the back and there's a

03:55.950 --> 04:00.220
lot going on but it's going to feel like a natural extension of our blog project.

04:00.300 --> 04:04.050
So let's discuss various things to know about this project and how to approach it.

04:04.120 --> 04:09.620
A hop back to the presentation slides now so as I previously mentioned you can download the zip files

04:09.650 --> 04:14.750
in this lecture for all of the code and this project workflow will also be a bit different than the

04:14.750 --> 04:16.040
previous project.

04:16.100 --> 04:20.300
We're going to be focusing on a more realistic development process where we build out applications one

04:20.300 --> 04:25.430
by one versus the previous project where we kind of built all the views first and then all the templates

04:25.440 --> 04:28.810
etc. We're actually going to focus on applications one at a time.

04:29.870 --> 04:34.280
And this approach we take here is definitely going to be more realistic but by its nature it's also

04:34.280 --> 04:39.690
going to contain a lot more debugging especially because some applications depend on other applications.

04:39.830 --> 04:44.450
And while the blogging isn't very fun when first learning a concept by now you've learned enough that

04:44.450 --> 04:49.220
you feel really comfortable enough to debug often so keep that in mind as you approach these videos

04:49.220 --> 04:51.050
you're going to see us debugging a lot.

04:51.050 --> 04:53.970
But it's definitely part of a realistic development process.

04:55.010 --> 04:55.510
OK.

04:55.720 --> 04:59.320
Another note is that we're also going to be using some outside libraries to keep this in mind.

04:59.320 --> 05:03.420
If you happen to just immediately run the file that's in the resource for this lecture.

05:03.460 --> 05:08.240
If you don't have the right modules installed you may get something that says No module names etc..

05:08.500 --> 05:13.270
Then these can be easily fixed of just a simple Pipp install in your environment or in your virtual

05:13.270 --> 05:17.620
environment and we'll do this in the video lectures as well as you run into those modules so keep that

05:17.620 --> 05:18.120
in mind.

05:18.280 --> 05:24.250
If you get something that says maybe no module named bootstrap theory then you may have to install bootstrap

05:24.250 --> 05:26.190
3 OK.

05:26.420 --> 05:31.350
This project is also specifically designed to feel like an extension of the previous block clone project.

05:31.400 --> 05:36.890
And what I really want to get across here is thinking of social media Web sites as extensions of simple

05:36.890 --> 05:42.590
blogs will really help your understanding as far as building a social media website with Django.

05:42.660 --> 05:48.180
So remember that we created a text blog for a single user really similar to medium dot com if it was

05:48.180 --> 05:51.050
just a simple single user blog site.

05:51.070 --> 05:56.220
Now we're going to try to do is expand this concept of a blog site to an actual social media site by

05:56.220 --> 05:58.160
simply expanding to multiple users.

05:58.170 --> 06:00.040
So let's think of this in some examples.

06:00.860 --> 06:01.520
Instagram.

06:01.550 --> 06:05.840
You could technically think of as just a photo blog with multiple users.

06:05.840 --> 06:09.960
Twitter is literally just a microblog service with Again multiple users.

06:10.100 --> 06:13.680
YouTube is just a video blog service with multiple users.

06:13.860 --> 06:14.330
They'll be full.

06:14.330 --> 06:19.190
However it does take a lot more work than I'm kind of throwing out here to build sites like these especially

06:19.190 --> 06:22.220
at scale but the basic premise is the same.

06:22.220 --> 06:27.190
We can expand the idea of a single blog for a single user attach multiple users to it.

06:27.350 --> 06:32.120
And now we're dealing with a social media network especially if things like Instagram Twitter or YouTube

06:32.360 --> 06:36.940
where they're especially focused on a particular type of post or blog.

06:37.080 --> 06:40.010
OK so these ideas are still there.

06:40.010 --> 06:43.980
More importantly you now have awesome jingle skills and we're going to learn even more.

06:44.090 --> 06:48.270
So let's get started building out our site of Social Network.

06:48.320 --> 06:49.910
Thanks and I'll see it the next lecture.
