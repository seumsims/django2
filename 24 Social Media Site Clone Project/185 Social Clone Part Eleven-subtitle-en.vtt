00:05.430 --> 00:11.760
Welcome everyone to Part 11 of the social club project before we can begin debugging we have to add

00:11.760 --> 00:14.070
in views for leaving and joining groups.

00:14.070 --> 00:19.170
We kind of left those views untouched and now we're going to add them in it's going to be too class

00:19.170 --> 00:24.350
based views and then we're going to connect them to the Urals not py file inside of the group's application.

00:24.390 --> 00:28.520
Once we've done that we should be ready to go for debugging and testing.

00:28.530 --> 00:32.340
The reason we have to do this before we actually jump straight into debugging is that we'll get a lot

00:32.340 --> 00:37.760
of errors because instead of a lot of our templates we're actually calling groups join in groups leave

00:37.770 --> 00:41.940
for those actual buttons and we need some sort of view to at least connect them.

00:42.120 --> 00:44.750
Let's hop over to the editor and finish that up.

00:45.730 --> 00:51.250
All right here we have the views the PI file for groups application and we help create group single

00:51.250 --> 00:55.130
group and list groups and I'm going to create two more class based views.

00:56.490 --> 01:01.720
And that's going to be a joint group I'll pass there for now.

01:01.760 --> 01:04.850
And a Leib group and they're gonna look really similar.

01:05.050 --> 01:09.050
Just one is going to be for leaving a group and another one's going to be for joining a group.

01:09.050 --> 01:10.550
Let's start with join group.

01:10.550 --> 01:15.500
First off to join a group should be logged in so will have log in required Mixon and we're going to

01:15.500 --> 01:18.070
use another generic class based view.

01:18.260 --> 01:20.750
And that one's going to be a redirect for you.

01:20.750 --> 01:25.820
So once someone clicks on join we should do some stuff on the back and for models to join the actual

01:25.940 --> 01:31.710
user to be a member of that group and then we're going to redirect to another page so that we can do

01:31.710 --> 01:40.150
here is say if there's a method we can define called Get redirect you are el.

01:40.370 --> 01:46.180
And that will allow us to grab whatever we wanted direct them to.

01:46.250 --> 01:52.710
Once they join it group will say self arcsin keyword arguments and we're going to return a reverse call.

01:52.820 --> 01:56.600
So in order to use reverse make sure you scroll up here and actually import it it's right here under

01:56.600 --> 01:58.870
your own resolver so we're good to go.

01:58.910 --> 02:03.110
The only collapse that directory tree get a little more room here and there we're going to redirect

02:03.110 --> 02:05.740
to groups single.

02:05.930 --> 02:08.740
So that will be the detail view of that particular group.

02:08.750 --> 02:13.370
Now in order to know what groups we're talking about we're going to add in a keyword arguments dictionary

02:14.180 --> 02:25.790
and it's just going to define slug as self keyword arguments lips self cured arguments get slug.

02:25.840 --> 02:31.530
Essentially you just get whatever slug of the page or clicking button that you're on the group of.

02:31.700 --> 02:37.640
And that's all you need to do forget redirect you are all and know what we can do is add in some more

02:37.640 --> 02:45.740
checks in case this person is already a member of the group so you can say the F gets and they will

02:45.740 --> 02:59.730
be self request and that takes an args and keyword arguments and a well-defined group as object.

02:59.740 --> 03:05.200
In fact we're going to need to import this was a good object or for or for which either means try to

03:05.200 --> 03:09.940
get the group that this person is currently looking at or return a four or four page.

03:09.940 --> 03:17.830
So in order to use this command we're going to scroll back up and then we'll say from jingo shortcuts

03:17.950 --> 03:21.130
import objects or four or four.

03:21.280 --> 03:25.570
And you also notice there's a get list option but we're just looking for a single object so just say

03:25.570 --> 03:29.180
group and then we will say group is what we want.

03:29.180 --> 03:37.790
So then we're going to add in a couple more things we will say group slug and slug is going to be able

03:37.790 --> 03:44.470
to self keyword arguments get slug

03:47.420 --> 04:02.850
and then we're going to try we will say group member objects creates user is equal to self request user

04:03.500 --> 04:06.570
work group is equal to a group.

04:06.570 --> 04:08.110
All right so what does that actually mean.

04:08.110 --> 04:13.810
I'm going to try to get the group member objects and create one where the user is equal to the current

04:13.810 --> 04:15.460
user and group to group.

04:15.460 --> 04:26.180
So creating a number and then I will have an accept accept and I can actually accept a specific error.

04:26.410 --> 04:29.680
So the specific error we're looking for is an integrity error.

04:29.820 --> 04:33.680
Well you don't have to technically you can just say except you don't have that right in the air here.

04:34.520 --> 04:38.190
So it can say integrity air.

04:38.440 --> 04:44.980
And then we will say messages warning and in order to use messages you're actually going to need to

04:44.980 --> 04:52.930
import it so let's scroll back to the top and say from Jingo that contrib import messages these are

04:52.930 --> 04:55.730
basically things we can send back to the user.

04:55.800 --> 05:02.940
So say from lips from Jingo that contrib import messages so we can send the message hey you're already

05:02.940 --> 05:03.710
a member of that group.

05:03.720 --> 05:11.110
If you're trying to join it again and then say itself the request and then we actually pass and what

05:11.110 --> 05:19.690
we want to warn here so we can say warning already a member so that will be if they're already a member

05:19.690 --> 05:21.440
we'll get some sort of error there.

05:21.680 --> 05:33.010
Else we're going to say is messages success Noll's say self-taught requests and then say is a second

05:33.660 --> 05:34.150
crap.

05:34.210 --> 05:39.070
This is not supposed to be an equal sign neither is this supposed to pass in the self.

05:39.100 --> 05:47.580
And then here we're going to say as a second argument you are now a member.

05:47.770 --> 05:49.190
We actually don't need these princes here.

05:49.210 --> 05:50.640
It's just the second argument.

05:51.070 --> 05:51.540
OK.

05:51.700 --> 05:53.980
So that should be it for that.

05:53.980 --> 06:04.730
And then at the end of all this get we're going to return calls super gets request arcs and then he

06:04.730 --> 06:08.690
word arguments and then save that.

06:08.770 --> 06:13.590
So we're doing here is if you're joining a group we have this redirect you are ill from this a view

06:13.860 --> 06:19.200
that just says OK once you join the group go back to that group's single detail page and then for this

06:19.200 --> 06:24.210
we want to make sure that a person is going to receive some sort of error or warning message if they're

06:24.210 --> 06:30.890
already inside the group and a good way to do that is by using jingoes built in messages from contrib.

06:31.020 --> 06:36.870
So using that you can just try to do what we would do which is grab a group member object and create

06:36.870 --> 06:43.230
it with the user equal to the current user and group equal to group which we just said Get object or

06:43.230 --> 06:43.620
create.

06:43.620 --> 06:44.970
So that's where groups coming from.

06:44.970 --> 06:51.240
So this group right here is linked to this group right here on line 29 and then we can say except integrity

06:51.240 --> 06:51.550
air.

06:51.570 --> 06:56.980
And you can just actually say except So if there's any sort of air you could just say for instance this.

06:57.000 --> 07:02.010
That's totally fine as well say that they were going to send some warning message says hey you're already

07:02.010 --> 07:02.780
a member.

07:02.850 --> 07:07.620
Otherwise if it works we'll say you're now a member and then we're just going to return super get requests

07:07.650 --> 07:15.750
and then Arkes and keyword arguments then we're going to fix this for LIBOR and actually be pretty similar.

07:15.750 --> 07:23.250
So for lebe group we're going to again say you should be log in to leave a group and we'll also have

07:23.310 --> 07:24.540
a generic redirector view.

07:24.540 --> 07:27.740
So once you leave a group you should be directed somewhere.

07:27.750 --> 07:30.880
So I'll say in fact this will just make it the exact same thing.

07:30.900 --> 07:34.470
Once you leave a group you get redirected to that group's page.

07:34.530 --> 07:39.240
You can also make it redirect to the home page if you want it to or the grouplets page but we'll keep

07:39.240 --> 07:41.810
things simple and experiment and Titian's right there is.

07:42.000 --> 07:46.200
So again pretty much the exact same thing when you leave a group you'll be redirected to that group's

07:46.220 --> 07:47.090
detail page.

07:47.280 --> 07:51.720
And then finally we'll have a get method very similar to the one we just made.

07:51.780 --> 08:01.780
So it's going to be self request arx keyword arguments to make sure that they can't accidentally leave

08:01.780 --> 08:03.670
a group that are not really in it.

08:03.670 --> 08:10.780
So we're going to do is first try we will try to get a object we'll call it membership and set that

08:10.780 --> 08:18.760
equal to models group member and they'll be objects and I'm going to filter those objects.

08:19.980 --> 08:29.650
And we will filter only start this new line user is equal to self request user and then group underscore

08:29.650 --> 08:41.780
underscore underscore underscore slug Ziegel to self-taught keyword arguments get slug and then off

08:41.860 --> 08:44.190
all that we're going to just call get method.

08:44.420 --> 08:49.610
So we're going to attempt to try to get a membership and that's all that group member assuming that

08:49.610 --> 08:51.610
the user is already in that group.

08:51.650 --> 08:57.620
So grab the group slug grab the user off that group member object and that's going to be my little membership

08:57.620 --> 09:05.700
that are going to be playing around with and then I'm going to be except now I can say models group

09:05.710 --> 09:09.610
member does not exist.

09:09.620 --> 09:12.550
That's an actual thing I can call off that group member object.

09:12.560 --> 09:17.660
So if that thing does happen to actually exist it means that group member was never actually a member

09:17.660 --> 09:18.300
of that group.

09:18.320 --> 09:24.350
So you excellently click delete button on a group you were never a member of to say messages warning

09:25.460 --> 09:26.930
self-taught request.

09:26.930 --> 09:36.830
Basically same thing we're doing last time and says Sorry you are in this group and let's say you are

09:36.830 --> 09:41.900
not so don't have to worry about syntax for single quotes.

09:41.920 --> 09:44.090
OK so sorry you are in the group.

09:44.090 --> 09:49.730
Else we're going to do is if everything's working we'll say membership and we can call a delete method

09:49.730 --> 09:57.580
off of this and then we're going to say messages and call a success message and then pasand the request

09:58.520 --> 10:12.070
request and says you have left the group then I'm going to return super gets passen request person or

10:12.120 --> 10:16.180
X and then person keyword arguments.

10:16.240 --> 10:18.680
OK so that should be looking good.

10:18.790 --> 10:22.850
I'm going to save this and the next thing I want to do is make sure I actually connect these views to

10:22.880 --> 10:24.430
my your stop PI file.

10:24.560 --> 10:25.810
So let's open that up.

10:25.860 --> 10:31.790
Else that pie inside of groups we have a couple of more views to do so we'll come over and we'll add

10:31.790 --> 10:36.940
in the leave and join view to the left profile we'll say you're all

10:39.520 --> 10:46.150
join forward slash and we will say we're actually going to just grab and copy and paste the same thing

10:46.150 --> 10:49.570
here.

10:49.870 --> 10:55.080
Join and then we will say views.

10:55.220 --> 11:01.990
Join a group and call that as a view and give that the name join since that's what we did in the templates.

11:02.440 --> 11:05.270
And then the other thing we're going to do is add in the leave.

11:05.590 --> 11:08.770
So let me just copy and paste this into the same thing.

11:08.770 --> 11:10.930
Copy paste instead of join.

11:10.980 --> 11:13.620
It's going to say leave and sort of join group.

11:13.630 --> 11:17.500
It will be great.

11:17.610 --> 11:24.660
And then set the name join it will be leave so we're going to save that and that's it for the join and

11:24.660 --> 11:26.620
leave views that we had to create.

11:26.910 --> 11:29.030
So again over and views.

11:29.520 --> 11:34.410
He's definitely more complicated views so we kind of waited till now for joining a group and leaving

11:34.410 --> 11:34.930
group.

11:34.950 --> 11:36.330
They're really really similar.

11:36.330 --> 11:37.630
They're both read direct views.

11:37.650 --> 11:41.260
Meaning you just kind of define OK what's this person's perform this action.

11:41.280 --> 11:42.470
Where should they go to.

11:42.570 --> 11:48.210
And that's the redirect view and I can actually pass keyword arguments and grab things off that current

11:48.430 --> 11:54.330
requests such as the slug that they're looking at to go to that detail page and then we have to get

11:54.330 --> 12:00.780
methods both in leave and join group and basically what these do is check to see if the user can actually

12:00.810 --> 12:02.360
perform the given action.

12:02.460 --> 12:04.240
If he didn't have these try except.

12:04.270 --> 12:05.340
Else calls here.

12:05.400 --> 12:12.150
You may just get broken pages if the person wasn't in the group and then try to join it and then try

12:12.150 --> 12:18.450
to join it again etc. instead of doing all that they can just have these messages show up and that will

12:18.450 --> 12:19.920
help fix any issues.

12:20.140 --> 12:21.650
OK so that's it.

12:21.660 --> 12:27.090
We should now be ready to take care of a few more things in settings that pi connect everything and

12:27.090 --> 12:28.190
start the bugginess.

12:28.320 --> 12:30.060
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
