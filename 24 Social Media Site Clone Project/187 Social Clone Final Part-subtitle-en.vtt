WEBVTT

00:05.310 --> 00:07.030
Welcome back everyone to the final part.

00:07.050 --> 00:09.420
The social clone project.

00:09.610 --> 00:11.840
Now our Web site actually has full functionality.

00:11.860 --> 00:17.680
We can sign up new users have them log in and they can create both groups and posts and the groups have

00:17.680 --> 00:20.920
a count of how many members they have and how many posts they have.

00:20.920 --> 00:25.870
Now we're going to go ahead and do is add in the SS and javascript files to give this Web site a cool

00:25.870 --> 00:26.500
look.

00:26.620 --> 00:30.250
And this is where you can diverge and customize the site to your own liking.

00:30.250 --> 00:34.420
We will copy and paste from the right notes and a lot of this code just comes from a code pen that's

00:34.420 --> 00:35.720
publicly available.

00:35.740 --> 00:41.100
But again this is really a personal preference up to you how you want to style your particular site.

00:41.290 --> 00:44.050
Let's up over to the notes and finish up this project.

00:44.050 --> 00:44.340
All right.

00:44.350 --> 00:49.090
Here I am in the editor and the first thing you want to do is make sure that in our settings that PI

00:49.090 --> 00:54.160
file we have the static files linked and if you scroll all the way down I believe we may have made a

00:54.160 --> 00:55.380
small typo.

00:55.480 --> 01:01.310
So you should have static underscore you all equal to static and static files underscore.

01:01.330 --> 01:03.490
It should be d i r s.

01:03.490 --> 01:05.230
So static file directories.

01:05.230 --> 01:07.660
And the reason for that is because you pass it in as a list.

01:07.660 --> 01:09.560
It could have multiple static directories.

01:09.640 --> 01:12.600
And then we say oh estopped path but join based directory static.

01:12.640 --> 01:17.950
So make sure you change that and save it so that it's static files underscore Diyar.

01:18.120 --> 01:23.740
That's ok once you have that what you need to do is come over to static and inside of simple social

01:23.740 --> 01:29.480
C Ss in javascript create a M.Z. SS file and a master javascript file.

01:29.560 --> 01:34.330
Now inside of these I've already copied and pasted the code from the notes as well as the code in this

01:34.420 --> 01:36.710
master CSSA other see a source file.

01:36.790 --> 01:40.480
In case you ever want to play around with other things you can link this as well.

01:40.480 --> 01:44.890
Mainly we're just going to be using the C S S file which essentially makes everything black and the

01:44.890 --> 01:49.310
color white and then this javascript file which is sourced from this Koeppen.

01:49.310 --> 01:54.400
So you have the link there and this is what allows you to set the stars when you click on something

01:54.400 --> 01:55.430
on the Web site.

01:55.870 --> 01:56.970
The stars will pop up.

01:57.160 --> 02:02.590
So right now the javascript master javascript file isn't linked yet so we're going to do is linked that

02:02.590 --> 02:04.460
to our baseline team l page.

02:04.480 --> 02:07.530
That way it shows up in every single page.

02:07.540 --> 02:12.430
So we'll come over to base that each T.M. scroll all the way down to the bottom because we want this

02:12.430 --> 02:17.800
to load after the entire body is loaded and we're going to add in a script call here.

02:17.980 --> 02:23.570
So script it's going to be type text javascript and then let's say the source.

02:23.590 --> 02:27.860
So the source is going to be static.

02:27.970 --> 02:35.120
So over the static directories and it's just simple social javascript slash M.Com jazz or whatever he

02:35.120 --> 02:36.220
happens to call it.

02:36.350 --> 02:38.040
So that's where we can find it.

02:38.300 --> 02:41.670
I'm going to save that and then this whole thing.

02:41.680 --> 02:43.790
The source should be in quotes itself.

02:45.210 --> 02:45.730
There we go.

02:45.800 --> 02:48.230
And the syntax heiling can kind of hint at that.

02:48.660 --> 02:51.980
OK so that should be all we need for that particular script.

02:51.990 --> 02:56.260
Let's save that change and then let's make sure we scroll up and actually loading the static files.

02:56.280 --> 02:59.310
Ok we are loading the static files so everything should work.

02:59.310 --> 03:01.820
Let's run this and finish up this project.

03:01.820 --> 03:07.300
Confirm we'd have no bugs right now coming to the Web site we can see here it says Welcome to our social.

03:07.320 --> 03:12.480
Everything's turned black and as we hover above buttons now they're kind of inversed in color and if

03:12.480 --> 03:18.000
you click somewhere here you'll end up seeing the stars being created so you can click a whole bunch

03:18.150 --> 03:21.360
and you'll see a bunch stars being created and that's basically it.

03:21.360 --> 03:27.750
Now given the way that the actual nav bar and the content is created there is kind of a buffer zone

03:27.780 --> 03:28.180
here.

03:28.260 --> 03:32.920
As far as the stars so they're bouncing off and there's essentially I can click here to close the border

03:32.920 --> 03:34.220
so you can see it.

03:34.360 --> 03:36.240
There is no way to go above that.

03:36.240 --> 03:41.010
Now you could spend a lot more time with CSSA and Javascript and make sure all these elements that their

03:41.010 --> 03:44.700
background and their canvas is linked so that the stars go everywhere.

03:44.700 --> 03:46.010
I mean kind of up to you.

03:46.080 --> 03:47.510
That's a lot more work on the front end.

03:47.550 --> 03:49.970
That's really not what jangles about.

03:50.010 --> 03:53.880
So really up to you how much you want to customize this if the stars are really your thing to be in

03:53.880 --> 03:59.160
with but that is an example of how you could spruce up your project and just make it look better.

03:59.240 --> 04:02.030
OK that's basically all there is to this project.

04:02.040 --> 04:02.940
Hope you had fun.

04:02.940 --> 04:09.300
The main thing to really get out of this project is creating users and creating groups of users and

04:09.300 --> 04:10.350
having them connect that way.

04:10.350 --> 04:16.070
So those two kind of model ideas essentially just an expansion off the blog project.

04:16.070 --> 04:16.710
All right.

04:16.740 --> 04:17.540
Hope you enjoyed it.

04:17.640 --> 04:19.560
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lectures.
