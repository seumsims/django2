00:05.310 --> 00:08.910
Hello everyone and welcome to the social cloning project part 10.

00:09.030 --> 00:14.040
Now that we have our views for the Post's app and the Eurostar profile complete let's create the template

00:14.040 --> 00:16.290
HTL files for the Post's pages.

00:16.290 --> 00:19.950
Once that is complete we can begin to debug in the next lecture.

00:19.950 --> 00:20.300
All right.

00:20.460 --> 00:22.540
Let's hop over to the editor and get started.

00:22.800 --> 00:28.850
All right so what I got ahead and done is under the Post's application or other templates under post

00:29.220 --> 00:34.190
I have the html files so we created earlier in the section of the course.

00:34.230 --> 00:38.180
Now we're going to do start off by editing post underscore Baystate HMO.

00:38.190 --> 00:40.110
This is the post based file.

00:40.320 --> 00:46.620
So first we're going to extend from our initial base that each team which has the navigation bar.

00:46.830 --> 00:51.750
And we're going to do a really similar thing here just like we did with the group based its HTML file.

00:51.750 --> 00:55.870
Let's create a block and this block is going to be called content.

00:56.090 --> 01:01.490
And then inside of this I'm going to create a class and this will be the Post's page in case I ever

01:01.490 --> 01:02.800
want to edit this.

01:02.930 --> 01:11.970
And then inside of that I'll create a container and then inside of that I'll create a row and then what

01:11.970 --> 01:17.720
we're gonna do here is just have three blocks and it's going to be just like we did with the groups

01:17.850 --> 01:25.570
they'll be pre-post the post content and then post post so pre-post and then I'm just going to delete

01:25.660 --> 01:28.300
this blank space and copy and paste this.

01:28.330 --> 01:34.010
So this should look really familiar to you after we did the group base.

01:34.030 --> 01:34.990
So pre-post.

01:34.990 --> 01:43.240
And then this is going to be called Post underscore content and then we'll call Post Post kind of a

01:43.540 --> 01:48.130
weird fortune with the words there but that's OK.

01:48.400 --> 01:52.990
And that's basically all you have to do with the post underscore base smell file just like we did with

01:52.990 --> 01:55.180
the group based the ex-teammate File.

01:55.240 --> 01:59.450
Coming up next we're going to do is create the post form.

01:59.590 --> 02:02.510
So I'm going to open up post underscore form.

02:02.530 --> 02:03.530
H Tim L.

02:03.550 --> 02:08.030
And this is the email template that's linked to creating a new post.

02:08.110 --> 02:11.730
We're going to say extends from post slash post.

02:11.730 --> 02:18.140
They start each team L and then we're going to load bootstrap 3.

02:18.170 --> 02:22.100
And hopefully this feels really familiar to you because this is essentially just like that group form

02:22.100 --> 02:28.980
page and then we're going to have our block and that will be the post content that we're going to say

02:29.000 --> 02:37.030
age 4 or age 3 whatever you want create a new post and then we'll insert a form here.

02:37.200 --> 02:42.950
And the class we actually will just give this ID in case we ever want to mess around with it.

02:42.990 --> 02:51.260
Just be post form id and then the action is going to go back to your old template there's going to be

02:51.310 --> 03:00.700
Yoro posts create and then we're going to say method is POSSO that's all we need here inside of the

03:00.700 --> 03:01.390
actual form.

03:01.390 --> 03:05.100
We need a couple of things one as always is Earthsea SRF tokin.

03:05.440 --> 03:08.010
Then we're going to actually call our form.

03:08.230 --> 03:10.390
So let's do that with a template tag.

03:10.570 --> 03:15.960
And this reason bootstrap three resequence say bootstrap underscore form make this look nice and then

03:15.970 --> 03:17.200
pass and form.

03:17.200 --> 03:19.130
Once you've done that which is the input button.

03:19.330 --> 03:26.740
So have the input button the type is submit the name that doesn't really need a name the value will

03:26.740 --> 03:29.450
give it the value of post so it can connect to it later.

03:29.480 --> 03:36.600
Then let's go ahead and give it a class based off some bootstrap things so say between between primary

03:36.680 --> 03:43.230
and a lot of this is really up to you by and large just style calls and that's all we have to do for

03:43.260 --> 03:44.570
the post form.

03:44.580 --> 03:48.720
So far everything is looking really similar to what we did with the group's application.

03:48.810 --> 03:55.110
The post base is really similar to that group base and then post forum really similar to the group forum.

03:55.110 --> 03:57.400
Now let's move on to the actual post list.

03:57.420 --> 03:58.360
H T.M..

03:58.410 --> 04:03.600
So again this is the post lists the html file the one I'm working in right now and we're going to do

04:03.600 --> 04:14.470
here is start off by extending to say extends post slash posts underscore based h tim L and then we're

04:14.470 --> 04:23.710
going to call our blocks or block we'll say pre post content and we'll start off here by saying div

04:24.190 --> 04:27.960
class call M.D dash 4.

04:28.090 --> 04:32.710
Then the next thing I want to do is check if a user is actually authenticated.

04:32.710 --> 04:39.260
So what I can do here is say if and here I need to call the request user is authenticated.

04:40.980 --> 04:48.300
And then inside of that we're going to say create a div class and we're going to use some kind of bootstrap

04:48.300 --> 04:51.940
stuff so card with shadow.

04:52.020 --> 04:55.260
Again this is all really styling calls so you don't have to do it this way.

04:55.260 --> 04:59.670
In fact you can just do no classes if you kind of wave a good idea of the bare bones content and then

04:59.670 --> 05:02.980
adding classes as you get more and more familiar bootstrap.

05:03.180 --> 05:11.100
But inside of this we'll have a whip's a title that we can later edit and this is just going to say

05:11.130 --> 05:15.160
your group's.

05:15.290 --> 05:22.210
So if the users log then we want to list out their groups and then we're going to say create an unordered

05:22.210 --> 05:26.630
list and we'll give this a class list.

05:26.780 --> 05:31.570
Onst I don't again you don't really need to follow along with his classes exactly.

05:31.580 --> 05:38.510
The next thing we're going to do inside this unordered list is say for member score group and just be

05:38.510 --> 05:40.920
a variable name whatever you want to call it in.

05:41.110 --> 05:47.420
And so we're going to look a little familiar we'll say get user groups and you might be wondering this

05:47.420 --> 05:51.030
looks a little familiar this underscore user groups.

05:51.050 --> 05:56.930
So what that actually is is if you remember back on the groups application when we were working with

05:56.930 --> 06:03.260
the models that PI file underneath groups we had this from Django import template register is equal

06:03.260 --> 06:05.280
to template library.

06:05.570 --> 06:10.940
And that actually allowed us to if we scroll down over here use this related name to actually grab that

06:10.970 --> 06:14.260
and you can add the underscore to connect to the group member.

06:14.270 --> 06:18.290
Now definitely check that documentation because this is more of an advanced thing but basically that

06:18.290 --> 06:23.140
allows us to do a link from the post to the group member.

06:23.430 --> 06:25.490
So we'll come back to post list.

06:25.530 --> 06:28.230
And now we're saying for member group and get user groups.

06:28.260 --> 06:33.600
Essentially if you're a user for every group that you're actually a member of where we're going to do

06:33.690 --> 06:38.430
is create a list item and that's going to be an anchor tag inside of that.

06:38.580 --> 06:49.720
And essentially it's just going to say your L groups single the slug let's make sure that's in single

06:49.720 --> 06:59.240
quotes and spaced out correctly for the slug here is equal to member underscore group dot group dot

06:59.380 --> 07:00.310
slug.

07:01.120 --> 07:01.500
OK.

07:01.590 --> 07:07.420
So basically grabbing the member group inside of all the users groups and then grabbing that group off

07:07.420 --> 07:10.540
of that model and then grabbing slug off for that group.

07:10.710 --> 07:15.300
So that's what that entire line is doing when me collapse tree so you can see the whole thing a little

07:15.300 --> 07:16.460
better.

07:16.560 --> 07:18.170
Definitely a more advanced call there.

07:18.330 --> 07:20.910
And what I'm going to do is add a class to that list element.

07:20.910 --> 07:22.870
So it just looks a little nicer in the future.

07:23.040 --> 07:26.940
So let's make this class equal to.

07:26.970 --> 07:35.700
And we're going say group and then add on Ally with bullet save that and then that's going to end our

07:35.700 --> 07:39.320
for loop and that will be the end of an ordered list.

07:39.480 --> 07:42.920
And we're going to keep going down until we get to that end if.

07:43.500 --> 07:43.740
OK.

07:43.740 --> 07:49.800
So so far we have that little view where someone can see all the groups that they belong to and then

07:49.800 --> 07:51.300
we're going to continue on after this.

07:51.300 --> 08:03.080
And if we'll create another div and we'll say Card card with chateau than inside of this will create

08:03.110 --> 08:12.630
a div the class call will be contents and then we'll say heading 5 and we'll give this a class equal

08:12.630 --> 08:21.120
to title and this will be just all groups in the same unordered list.

08:21.120 --> 08:30.340
And inside let's give this a class B list list dash and style in case we ever edit that.

08:30.350 --> 08:32.670
And here we're going to say is another for loop.

08:32.730 --> 08:46.290
We'll say for other group in get underscore other underscore groups create a list elements and then

08:46.370 --> 08:50.650
we will say create anchor tag where the reference is going to be the following.

08:50.790 --> 08:54.370
All groups single essentially we just did.

08:54.570 --> 09:01.980
The slug is equal to make sure that single quotes there correctly go where that slug is equal to other

09:01.980 --> 09:04.830
group slug.

09:05.230 --> 09:10.960
So there I'm not actually calling a member group so I don't need to call other group that group the

09:10.960 --> 09:13.680
group itself is right here and there other group.

09:13.810 --> 09:19.030
OK now we'll end the four and let's also give this list a nice class that looks a little nicer.

09:19.030 --> 09:26.950
So this list element is going to have a class equal to group and we'll say ally with a bullet.

09:28.570 --> 09:36.130
And say that if a bullet and then end that for a loop then finally all the way past this unordered list

09:36.190 --> 09:42.000
and all the lives right after this end block we're going to scroll down and create another block here.

09:42.270 --> 09:51.030
So will say block post content and then inside of this we'll say div class and this is going to be called

09:51.040 --> 09:54.950
to call M.D 8.

09:55.340 --> 10:01.560
Now we're going to save for the post in post list.

10:01.620 --> 10:05.340
We will inject that underscore post which we're going to work on in just a little bit.

10:05.340 --> 10:06.540
We'll say include.

10:06.690 --> 10:13.860
We've actually already seen this before in the groups pages will say posts underscore poster T.M. and

10:13.860 --> 10:15.060
then save that.

10:15.690 --> 10:21.150
So here include are going to be able to inject post H.C. email and we have these two basic things one

10:21.150 --> 10:23.800
is checking if the request geezer's authenticated.

10:23.820 --> 10:27.730
We have that list right here of those member groups.

10:28.070 --> 10:29.330
OK saving that.

10:29.340 --> 10:30.330
Let's move along.

10:30.540 --> 10:31.660
I'm going to close this.

10:31.680 --> 10:33.770
So let's deal with the actual underscore.

10:33.770 --> 10:35.230
Post to each team l file.

10:35.310 --> 10:38.920
Since I just down here said include it so I will open up.

10:38.940 --> 10:43.040
Underscore postdates e-mails underscore post.

10:43.140 --> 10:44.710
H Tim L that I'm about to do.

10:44.770 --> 10:50.850
Let's underscore again find your underscore postdates kill file and then hear what you will do is we

10:50.850 --> 10:57.330
actually don't need to extend from because we know we're directly going to inject this right here we're

10:57.330 --> 11:01.620
not going to have it be part of a full page by itself.

11:01.620 --> 11:03.740
So in that case we actually don't need say extends.

11:03.990 --> 11:10.560
Instead we basically start right where we want to which is going to be something like a div so have

11:10.560 --> 11:16.680
a div here and then the heading 3 is going to just be the post message.

11:16.740 --> 11:25.970
Each T.M. and then we want it to be safe so that it looks good we'll say DIVX and we'll give this class

11:26.510 --> 11:27.350
media abody

11:30.080 --> 11:33.800
and then we'll have a strong call here are bulled it doesn't really matter.

11:33.820 --> 11:36.410
We've post user the user name.

11:36.660 --> 11:44.260
It's the actual name of the person here that's going to be the at symbol and then we'll have H5 and

11:44.260 --> 11:49.520
let's give this a class of media heading.

11:49.600 --> 11:54.430
And again we may or may not use all these classes really up to you that after that we're going to have

11:54.430 --> 12:02.690
a span and then we will say let's give this band a class for user name OK.

12:02.690 --> 12:08.490
And then inside of this we will say give an anchor tag that anchor tag.

12:08.710 --> 12:12.740
It's going to be a URL reference so you are l two posts.

12:12.820 --> 12:17.460
Make sure that's in quotes posts for the user.

12:17.470 --> 12:23.500
So that's essentially a link to that actual user's individual posts and then or the user name is equal

12:23.500 --> 12:27.870
to post user or user name.

12:28.570 --> 12:29.720
OK so what does that actually mean.

12:29.740 --> 12:36.550
Well basically we're going to have the post message and then whoever wrote the post that means the actual

12:36.630 --> 12:41.450
username and then if you click on that username which is going to be something like Jose or at Sindy

12:41.480 --> 12:47.120
etcetera whatever their username is it will take you to all the posts for up to kill user.

12:47.260 --> 12:51.670
And this essentially is the link between clicking on someone's name and then viewing their quote unquote

12:51.670 --> 12:52.290
profile.

12:52.300 --> 12:56.400
In our case the profile is really simple it's just a list of all the user's posts.

12:56.810 --> 12:57.100
OK.

12:57.190 --> 13:05.310
So that ends that span the next you're going to do is create a little time tag.

13:05.530 --> 13:11.110
So the time tag is actually going to allow us to post the time and that's going to essentially indicate

13:11.290 --> 13:14.170
what time was this post created.

13:14.350 --> 13:19.750
So we'll give this class equal to time in case we ever want to edit that.

13:19.870 --> 13:26.500
And then inside of this will be in other anchor tag and then we'll say Tref And let's just have this

13:26.500 --> 13:41.280
take you back to your L posts single where the user name is equal to postop user the user name where

13:41.280 --> 13:44.970
the primary key is equal to the post primary key.

13:45.390 --> 13:50.540
Okay great then we can actually kind of close that off in case it's getting too long and that will end

13:50.610 --> 13:56.480
that time and then all we should do is actually paste this whole thing inside of the heading when we

13:56.490 --> 14:00.040
grab that closing tag and paste it right here.

14:01.160 --> 14:01.690
There we go.

14:01.700 --> 14:03.800
And then we have our div tags.

14:03.800 --> 14:06.020
So let's continue on by right after this.

14:06.020 --> 14:16.150
H5 we're going to create a new div and we'll give it again media filter class filter and we're going

14:16.150 --> 14:24.030
to say if inside of this if statement I will check if the user is authenticated.

14:24.340 --> 14:30.730
So if the user is authenticated and they also want to confirm that not only is the user a log then but

14:30.730 --> 14:33.410
the actual post is it the users post.

14:33.410 --> 14:39.560
So I want to say and if Post user is equal to the current user.

14:39.760 --> 14:44.140
So if those two things are true then this person should be able to delete the post.

14:44.140 --> 14:54.430
Which means we're going to have an anchor tag here and we'll send them to your all of posts delete where

14:54.460 --> 14:59.490
the primary key is equal to postop primary key.

14:59.940 --> 15:04.350
OK and then let's go ahead and give this couple of more things here.

15:04.390 --> 15:07.870
You can also give something like a title if you really wanted to.

15:08.050 --> 15:13.640
So we could say title delete and then let's also give this a class.

15:13.640 --> 15:19.490
So I was getting a little too far going to continue if they could take their class this will just be

15:19.730 --> 15:27.670
a basic class between BT and dash simple it's a simple button there.

15:27.880 --> 15:35.110
And then inside of this let's actually create a spam's we can call a glyph icon I'll say class and then

15:35.110 --> 15:52.700
glyph icon glyph I can remove text danger and then we're also going to say oops that's it in school

15:52.710 --> 15:54.010
too true.

15:56.200 --> 16:01.520
And basically you may have seen hidden before but you haven't seen a are I a hit.

16:01.840 --> 16:07.180
So what that is that's accessible rich Internet applications and that finds a way to make the Web content

16:07.180 --> 16:10.120
in web applications more accessible to people with disabilities.

16:10.120 --> 16:14.860
So basically what happens is if certain people have disabilities they have screen readers so they kind

16:14.860 --> 16:18.400
of hover their mouse or they open up a window and it starts reading stuff for them.

16:18.400 --> 16:22.510
So instead of just saying hidden for people with those disabilities are using the screen readers we

16:22.510 --> 16:25.730
have this ere are I a cache hidden.

16:25.750 --> 16:30.550
And basically what that means is the hidden attribute that's new and each team of five it tells browsers

16:30.550 --> 16:35.500
not to display the element and this particular one tells screen readers to ignore the element and not

16:35.500 --> 16:36.440
read it out loud.

16:36.440 --> 16:40.870
So again this is actually just kind of keeping an eye on people with disabilities and putting it in

16:40.880 --> 16:42.240
their.

16:42.300 --> 16:44.700
So let's continue along after that.

16:44.720 --> 16:47.510
We're going to just create the actual delete.

16:47.510 --> 16:53.520
So we'll see span let's not Spain.

16:53.820 --> 16:55.480
Make sure to right that again.

16:55.470 --> 17:00.140
Spam and let's give this a class equal to text.

17:00.160 --> 17:07.620
Dash danger icon dash label and will say delete.

17:07.760 --> 17:09.300
That's going to be the end if there.

17:09.300 --> 17:12.260
And that's it for this underscore post.

17:12.260 --> 17:15.340
So you should have three closing divs after that.

17:15.380 --> 17:16.520
At the very bottom.

17:16.940 --> 17:17.430
OK.

17:17.600 --> 17:19.210
So that's it for underscore.

17:19.210 --> 17:19.700
Post.

17:19.700 --> 17:20.760
We saw a couple of more things.

17:20.780 --> 17:25.820
Do we finished underscore post Finnis post underscore ascorbate CML haven't confirmed delete.

17:25.820 --> 17:27.440
So let's take care of that now.

17:27.470 --> 17:28.550
That was pretty straightforward.

17:28.550 --> 17:40.400
We're going to do is say extends post slash post base lips each T.M. and then we're going to say a block

17:40.490 --> 17:44.660
of post content.

17:44.760 --> 17:53.490
Let's create a heading three asking something like Are you sure you want to delete this post.

17:53.520 --> 18:04.550
Questionmark then inside of this will say DIVX and loops enter and then we'll say class posts.

18:04.880 --> 18:09.230
And this is where we're going to include to include

18:11.570 --> 18:19.580
PPO's slash underscore poster each symbol and then we can say it with post equal to object and then

18:19.580 --> 18:23.660
we'll say hide delete equal to true.

18:23.830 --> 18:26.190
We make sure that an XLE doubles here.

18:26.550 --> 18:29.120
OK so there's a little include inside of that div.

18:29.700 --> 18:35.880
So I actually kind of includes a poster going to delete and then finally we need our form so the form

18:36.450 --> 18:38.270
doesn't need a class C we need an action.

18:38.280 --> 18:46.620
We just need a method to post Ticken a quick C S a token and then will say input type is submit essentially

18:46.620 --> 18:48.690
just saying yes I want to delete.

18:48.800 --> 18:53.610
We can give it a value of confirmed delete just to make it really obvious to the user that they're about

18:53.610 --> 19:00.730
to delete their posts confirm deletes and then skip this class good class.

19:00.740 --> 19:08.530
Probably danger button and let's give it large So we have this beauty in beauty and danger between large

19:09.010 --> 19:11.720
and will create a link here.

19:12.740 --> 19:22.290
For your L posts single is essentially going to be the cancelbot that we're building out.

19:22.370 --> 19:27.890
User name is equal to user not user name since we know they have to be logged in to even reach this

19:27.890 --> 19:33.100
page and then primary key will just be object the primary key.

19:33.220 --> 19:36.500
Actually just the way to go back and let's make sure it's spelt right.

19:36.500 --> 19:40.160
You are l.

19:40.250 --> 19:45.910
Go so they can either hit this or confirm the input button which submits that the DO want delete this

19:46.330 --> 19:50.710
which is linked to our delete view or they have this cancel button which supposed to be essentially

19:50.740 --> 19:59.630
a link here and then let's say cancel OK perfect and actually we need to give this a class.

19:59.630 --> 20:00.960
It looks good.

20:00.960 --> 20:08.490
So instead of this anchor tag I'm going to give the class it will have that class speak to say between

20:08.550 --> 20:15.280
batin dashed simple beats and large between the thoughts.

20:15.370 --> 20:16.590
It just keeps attacking them.

20:16.620 --> 20:18.380
That really doesn't matter.

20:18.420 --> 20:18.900
OK.

20:19.140 --> 20:20.340
So that's looking good.

20:20.340 --> 20:21.280
That's the end of our form.

20:21.300 --> 20:22.480
That should be in the book.

20:22.530 --> 20:27.600
So there is the confirmed delete essentially just saying OK you want to delete this if not take them

20:27.600 --> 20:30.810
back to that actual post the individual post the tell you.

20:31.140 --> 20:32.490
OK speaking of detail.

20:32.550 --> 20:34.540
That's one of the ones you have left.

20:34.680 --> 20:39.140
We have post forum posts list and we selected a user post list which is going to be really similar post

20:39.180 --> 20:39.450
list.

20:39.450 --> 20:42.250
But let's take out that post the till page first.

20:42.450 --> 20:44.770
Luckily for us we actually took care of a lot of that work.

20:44.970 --> 20:55.540
So we just need to extend from post posts underscore base HTL and then say give a block of post underscore

20:56.110 --> 21:01.290
content create a div class of call dash.

21:01.340 --> 21:03.660
The Dash 8.

21:03.890 --> 21:08.760
And then we're just going to include post slash underscore postdates smell.

21:08.810 --> 21:13.610
That's all we have to do because basically all the heavy lifting of the actual post detail page was

21:13.610 --> 21:17.010
done an underscore posterized C.M. perfect.

21:17.030 --> 21:18.870
So we're going to have that ready to go.

21:19.980 --> 21:24.970
Then we have post four minutes ago post list and we just need the user post lists which is actually

21:24.970 --> 21:25.630
quite simple.

21:25.660 --> 21:36.660
So a user post list is going to extends from posts underscore posts based T.M. will have a block here

21:36.660 --> 21:44.370
for the pre-post and then inside of this we'll have a div and let's make this be call M.D for

21:47.140 --> 21:56.540
each one and we'll say it's call say post user dot username.

21:56.760 --> 21:59.170
So that actually shows the user name before the post.

21:59.170 --> 22:03.760
You can also put this above the post isn't really meant or below the post so either above or below the

22:03.760 --> 22:05.170
post where we prefer these names.

22:05.170 --> 22:06.580
That's fine.

22:06.600 --> 22:10.850
We're going to say block post content.

22:12.060 --> 22:13.530
We're created for this.

22:13.560 --> 22:16.010
And the class is going to be call dash.

22:16.020 --> 22:26.960
The Dash 8 is going to be a for loop that says for post in post underscore list.

22:27.110 --> 22:37.530
What we'll do is include Post forward slash underscore poster HTL say that and then that's actually

22:37.530 --> 22:39.710
it for user post list.

22:39.720 --> 22:40.200
OK.

22:40.350 --> 22:43.330
So definitely did a lot of the heavy lifting for the templates.

22:43.330 --> 22:46.680
This is stuff that is really easy to make a typo and I'm sure I've made one.

22:46.680 --> 22:49.890
Along the way which you're going to be the bugging in just a little bit.

22:50.070 --> 22:54.840
So in the very next lecture we're going to do is make sure all our settings and our migrations are ready

22:54.840 --> 22:56.870
to go and then we'll start debugging.

22:57.090 --> 23:02.220
Definitely check against the provided note files to make sure that everything you have matches up with

23:02.220 --> 23:03.330
those no files.

23:03.330 --> 23:05.180
Thanks everyone and I'll see if the next lecture.
