00:05.230 --> 00:08.830
Welcome everyone to part 12 of the social clone project.

00:09.030 --> 00:13.750
Now go ahead and try running our application our Web site and see if there's any debugging that we need

00:13.750 --> 00:14.200
to do.

00:14.200 --> 00:15.920
I'm sure we've made typos along the way.

00:16.030 --> 00:17.920
So let's see how we can actually fix those.

00:17.920 --> 00:22.090
We also need to make sure we do our migrations and double check our settings that PI file so that the

00:22.090 --> 00:26.790
applications that we just created groups and post are actually inside that setting that profile.

00:26.980 --> 00:32.560
Let's get started ok here and back at the editor and I want to open up our settings that py files under

00:32.560 --> 00:33.850
simple social project.

00:33.910 --> 00:39.070
Open up settings that pi and then I'm going to scroll down to the installed apps and I want to make

00:39.070 --> 00:47.040
sure that we add in the groups app that we've made as well as the Post's app.

00:47.200 --> 00:51.970
So we will save that and I also want to make sure that we do the migrations so I'm going to clear my

00:51.970 --> 00:59.200
console or CLX if you're on Windows and then say Python managed up high so make sure and then the right

00:59.200 --> 00:59.950
one.

01:00.100 --> 01:07.200
See the two simple social Python managed at PI and then I'm going to type migrate it should complain

01:08.380 --> 01:09.330
and we'll run that.

01:09.370 --> 01:09.940
OK great.

01:09.940 --> 01:10.700
So it complains.

01:10.720 --> 01:19.800
So we're going to do say Python managed up-I make migrations and we'll start off with groups hit enter

01:20.280 --> 01:27.790
and then want to do Python manage that PI make migrations and then we'll do posts enter and then files

01:27.800 --> 01:32.000
say Python managed up PI migrate and then it's ready to go.

01:32.250 --> 01:35.400
So now it's actually try running this and see if we need to debug anything.

01:35.400 --> 01:38.980
I'll say Python managed up high run server.

01:39.410 --> 01:40.370
Ok it looks like it's running.

01:40.380 --> 01:42.020
Let's hop over to our browser.

01:42.320 --> 01:44.990
OK my browser everything's looking like it's functioning.

01:44.990 --> 01:49.640
So let's actually log in and see if we can create a new group and then create a new post in it.

01:49.710 --> 01:51.060
I will log in.

01:51.060 --> 01:53.590
Actually let's sign up just to make sure everything's working.

01:53.640 --> 01:59.180
So I will sign up as Jose my e-mail address will just be Jose at gmail dot com.

01:59.310 --> 02:01.900
That's not my real email address so don't bother.

02:01.950 --> 02:09.690
Whoever that Jose is will say yes password just password and then sign up.

02:10.120 --> 02:17.290
Ok now I'm going to log in username Jose password is test password log in and it says now we're logged

02:17.290 --> 02:17.500
in.

02:17.500 --> 02:18.180
Great.

02:18.220 --> 02:19.540
So I have this create group.

02:19.570 --> 02:21.900
So let's try creating a group on that.

02:21.900 --> 02:26.220
Actually we haven't linked that yet so we still need to on our actual navigation bar.

02:26.230 --> 02:27.480
Make sure that's working.

02:27.490 --> 02:28.610
So that's something we can add in.

02:28.630 --> 02:31.850
Let's go ahead and hop over to the editor and fix that.

02:31.860 --> 02:37.900
So back in the editor I will open up the base h team I'll file that's the one that actually has a navigation

02:37.900 --> 02:43.510
bar let me collapse my directory tree so based on age HTML where the navigation bar is remember I have

02:43.510 --> 02:46.600
all these kind of missing links so let's add those in.

02:46.950 --> 02:56.720
First the your URL for a post is just going to be your goal posts create and then for groups.

02:56.760 --> 02:59.490
It's going to be it's the template tag here.

03:00.930 --> 03:08.090
Dorel groups all and then four create groups.

03:08.110 --> 03:09.160
It's going to be

03:12.350 --> 03:19.060
groups create and then let's also fix this one so.

03:19.070 --> 03:27.220
Else we will say groups and that will be your el groups all.

03:27.250 --> 03:28.680
So the list of all the groups.

03:28.720 --> 03:29.940
OK save that.

03:30.090 --> 03:34.250
And now let's hop back over here and refresh this page.

03:34.470 --> 03:37.980
And I have a syntax error so it says groups create expected.

03:37.990 --> 03:39.260
Elif Elser and.

03:39.300 --> 03:41.650
Did you forget to register or load this tag.

03:41.880 --> 03:48.780
So let's make sure it was actually groups create for the groups creation page and a hop back over and

03:48.780 --> 03:49.890
make sure I fix that.

03:50.100 --> 03:53.380
So here am seeing groups create and looks like it for its Taipan.

03:53.550 --> 03:54.810
So not going to save that.

03:54.850 --> 03:56.030
It'll refresh again.

03:57.010 --> 03:57.360
OK.

03:57.400 --> 04:00.270
So it looks like post is not a registered namespace.

04:00.280 --> 04:01.270
So what does that actually mean.

04:01.270 --> 04:05.590
Well it says error during template rendering based on each T.M. line 29.

04:05.590 --> 04:10.030
So if I come over here it says posts create it's not valid.

04:10.030 --> 04:12.100
Let's make sure that you're not py file.

04:12.090 --> 04:14.600
I've actually defined posts as the app name.

04:14.860 --> 04:16.210
So hop back over here.

04:17.140 --> 04:19.470
Open up my directory Chewey under posts.

04:19.510 --> 04:23.070
I'll open up your All-Starr pie looks like my app name is registered.

04:23.080 --> 04:25.810
So now let's make sure we have create registered.

04:25.870 --> 04:27.650
It looks like that's working as well.

04:27.790 --> 04:32.470
Which means it may be an issue with the Urals that py file in the project level.

04:32.470 --> 04:35.780
So let's go over to your oles that pie at a project level.

04:35.800 --> 04:40.690
And if I scroll down here it looks like I still have the groups and post links so that's definitely

04:40.690 --> 04:41.790
something I need to add in.

04:41.940 --> 04:45.760
It's a good thing where the buggy now and hopefully this is kind of obvious to you as you kind of went

04:45.760 --> 04:46.670
along here.

04:46.780 --> 04:52.960
So I'll do Khama add in your l and now it's time to register post-soul say using regular expression

04:54.000 --> 05:00.160
curat posts and essentially just linking to the actual post-soul say include.

05:00.480 --> 05:02.270
And I'm going to include posts.

05:02.770 --> 05:04.120
Or else.

05:04.180 --> 05:07.850
And then let's give it a name space which is essentially what it was complaining about.

05:08.950 --> 05:10.420
So this was the era that we were getting.

05:10.420 --> 05:13.160
It wasn't complaining about the other posts.

05:13.420 --> 05:15.920
And let's add one more here for the groups.

05:18.100 --> 05:27.940
So we'll say Kurt groups forward slash then I'm going to include groups stop your else and then give

05:27.940 --> 05:33.810
a name space equal to groups and I will save that.

05:34.070 --> 05:34.610
OK.

05:34.750 --> 05:35.470
Perfect.

05:35.530 --> 05:37.810
Now try again you can see auto restarted for us.

05:37.810 --> 05:41.490
We'll come back over here refreshed the page says Now I'm logged in.

05:41.530 --> 05:42.550
It's looking good.

05:42.550 --> 05:46.770
Let's get on groups and it says welcome back at Jose that's looking good.

05:46.870 --> 05:48.170
Groups Welcome to the group's page.

05:48.190 --> 05:52.230
And then of that I'm noxious plus sign but it says create new group.

05:52.240 --> 05:55.030
Obviously we can add more CSSA styling to make that look better.

05:55.030 --> 05:59.310
Let's try getting create group here make sure that works so that works as well.

05:59.320 --> 06:03.550
I'm going to go back to space and make sure this button works as well and it looks like they're taking

06:03.550 --> 06:05.290
us to the same groups new.

06:05.350 --> 06:06.850
So that's looking good.

06:06.860 --> 06:13.490
I will say first group and description will be my first group.

06:13.670 --> 06:14.780
Then hit create.

06:15.050 --> 06:15.690
OK.

06:15.860 --> 06:18.230
Looks like we have an issue here says groups name.

06:18.230 --> 06:19.380
Reverse is not defined.

06:19.460 --> 06:25.400
So hopefully by now you kind of realize I probably forgot to import reverse somewhere so somewhere along

06:25.400 --> 06:27.430
the line I need a reverse call.

06:27.430 --> 06:32.220
I probably called it but didn't actually import it because it says name reverse is not defined.

06:32.300 --> 06:38.320
So let's go back and make sure in our group's file or we're actually having that create group view.

06:38.420 --> 06:39.770
We imported reverse.

06:39.840 --> 06:41.160
So welcome back.

06:41.300 --> 06:47.940
So coming back to my actual editor I can now see if I expand my command line here that I get this name.

06:47.940 --> 06:50.400
Err name reverse not defined in going up.

06:50.400 --> 06:56.120
It actually tells me where it's coming from it's coming from simple social groups models not by line

06:56.120 --> 06:58.050
30 and get absolute L.

06:58.220 --> 06:59.580
So that's probably where the issue is.

06:59.580 --> 07:02.170
So let's go ahead and find that models that py file.

07:02.260 --> 07:05.730
It's not in views so we're willing to scroll down a little bit.

07:05.750 --> 07:10.990
Come over to models PI and then over here we're actually going to see if we can fix that mistake.

07:11.000 --> 07:13.910
So over in line 30 it says if you scroll down.

07:13.910 --> 07:15.120
Return reverse.

07:15.200 --> 07:17.820
So it looks like we just forgot to import reverse.

07:17.870 --> 07:27.190
So now we'll come back up here and we'll save from jingo core your resolvers in poor reverse.

07:27.560 --> 07:31.490
OK so we will now save that and it looks like it's running again.

07:31.490 --> 07:32.930
Come back up here.

07:33.170 --> 07:36.200
Go back and then refresh this page.

07:36.230 --> 07:44.860
And let's try a second group and we'll labeled scription of second try create.

07:44.900 --> 07:48.530
All right so now back at the page after refreshing it looks like a group was created.

07:48.530 --> 07:50.360
Now the fonts actually really large here.

07:50.480 --> 07:53.140
That's because I'm zoomed in 200 percent so keep that in mind.

07:53.270 --> 07:56.690
A lot of the things that we do have bootstrap may look a little strange here just because I'm zoomed

07:56.690 --> 08:01.940
in so much to make sure you guys can see clearly but we have the second group member count is zero.

08:01.940 --> 08:04.660
Let's try to join this group and see if it works.

08:04.670 --> 08:07.190
I joined and now the member count is 1 and let's leave.

08:07.190 --> 08:13.460
See if that works and looks like we have a problem with leave so it says name models is not defined.

08:13.700 --> 08:19.130
So over here we're saying models not group member the object filter and that's in the views that py

08:19.130 --> 08:20.690
file of our groups.

08:20.840 --> 08:26.180
So looks like we forgot to import models or do something for actual views that py file inside a group

08:26.180 --> 08:27.730
slut's head over and mixture.

08:27.830 --> 08:33.650
We actually imported the group models will come back over here and this is the views that py file and

08:33.650 --> 08:38.840
what I need to do on is from the import models.

08:38.840 --> 08:42.770
Save that now let's head back and refresh this page.

08:43.930 --> 08:45.870
And looks like we're still getting leave.

08:45.870 --> 08:48.300
Group has KQ 0 6.

08:48.490 --> 08:50.750
Definitely misspelled something here that should have been a W.

08:50.920 --> 08:56.140
So again we'll come back over here and let's see if we can search for that K-Q.

08:56.140 --> 08:56.730
There you go.

08:56.740 --> 08:58.770
That should be KW args.

08:58.810 --> 09:03.610
Save that and make sure that there's double asterisks here as well and will come back.

09:03.640 --> 09:09.380
Refresh the page and number count 0 so try joining again and illustrate leaving again.

09:09.500 --> 09:11.130
It looks like it's working perfect.

09:11.290 --> 09:12.850
Now there's no post in this group.

09:12.910 --> 09:20.740
So try posting something I'll click on post and say this is my first test post exclamation point in

09:20.740 --> 09:21.570
under group.

09:21.720 --> 09:24.680
Just to assign this to second group post.

09:24.700 --> 09:29.560
All right now we get this error that says user posts object has no attribute post and the fact that

09:29.560 --> 09:31.120
it's saying has no attribute.

09:31.220 --> 09:35.250
You remember you call attributes with a dot or period meaning.

09:35.260 --> 09:40.360
Probably somewhere along the line I'm calling Post Office something where I really shouldn't be doing

09:40.360 --> 09:40.840
that.

09:41.050 --> 09:45.990
And it says right here it's under simple social post views that pie in line 28.

09:46.030 --> 09:50.920
So let's head back to views that pi and other posts views that pi.

09:50.920 --> 09:51.990
Here it is.

09:52.060 --> 09:55.050
I'm going to take a look at this on line 28.

09:55.060 --> 10:00.820
I can see here I'm saying try self-taught post thought user equals a user object.

10:00.820 --> 10:03.220
Really what it should have been doing is assigning this.

10:03.220 --> 10:08.630
So here I said self-taught post underscore user and that's actually what I meant to do.

10:08.630 --> 10:09.650
Inline 28.

10:09.790 --> 10:15.130
Basically creating this attribute object or editing this Ashby object of posts user.

10:15.130 --> 10:19.150
So now that I've saved that let's send it back over and refreshed the page.

10:19.600 --> 10:20.950
OK it looks like Jose.

10:20.980 --> 10:26.450
I can see this is my first test post and it just says delete here let's try that.

10:27.330 --> 10:30.410
Going to try to delete and looks like template does not exist.

10:30.420 --> 10:32.570
Post delete one post.

10:32.580 --> 10:39.370
Post based I aced team else so somewhere along the line we are getting a failure for post underscore

10:39.460 --> 10:42.050
Bass says this template doesn't exist.

10:42.060 --> 10:44.540
Let's head back and figure that out.

10:44.720 --> 10:50.070
Then hop back over and let's confirm that we do have a post underscore bass so that looks good meaning

10:50.100 --> 10:51.640
over here on the Confirm delete.

10:51.720 --> 10:56.370
Probably something is happening here that's wrong and it says X10 posts.

10:56.400 --> 11:03.390
Post a female looks like X only have double quotes there so let's delete those save it and then try

11:03.390 --> 11:05.430
again see if that fixes the issue.

11:06.340 --> 11:07.000
And there we go.

11:07.160 --> 11:11.410
So it was just an issue of accidently having double quotes there and that extents call.

11:11.670 --> 11:13.550
So it says Now are you sure you want to leave this post.

11:13.550 --> 11:15.330
Let's try to confirm delete.

11:15.380 --> 11:16.970
It looks like messages are not defined.

11:16.970 --> 11:19.580
That probably means I didn't import messages.

11:19.580 --> 11:20.570
So that's under it.

11:20.570 --> 11:29.050
Views that py inline 70 going head over posts of used up by line 17 if you take a look at it.

11:29.180 --> 11:30.340
Messages success.

11:30.350 --> 11:31.720
I forgot to import that.

11:31.890 --> 11:40.240
So save from Django and I believe from them contrib import messages save that come back here and I'm

11:40.240 --> 11:44.320
going to refresh this continue and it looks like it delete that post.

11:44.320 --> 11:47.360
Please try again to make sure that's working for US groups.

11:47.380 --> 11:53.950
I see all the groups all come to first group or join that group and then I'm going to post to first

11:53.950 --> 11:55.250
group this time.

11:55.300 --> 12:01.500
OK so let's see if this is working.

12:01.680 --> 12:03.310
Let's put this to first group.

12:03.310 --> 12:04.030
Post it.

12:04.270 --> 12:07.870
OK let's see it is working Jose and willing to delete this.

12:07.870 --> 12:11.210
Are you sure you want to please post let's see if it's working confirmed delete.

12:11.290 --> 12:15.700
It looks like deleted it now right now what's happening is the redirect is probably not working after

12:15.700 --> 12:18.010
delete so we should definitely check that as well.

12:18.070 --> 12:22.560
And if you notice off the posts it looks like the date or time stamp wasn't working as well.

12:22.570 --> 12:26.700
So if we come back to groups let me add a post here so I'm going to.

12:26.700 --> 12:30.310
Why not actually actually join it in this post.

12:30.550 --> 12:35.060
So just say blah blah group second group post.

12:35.230 --> 12:39.160
And now if I take a look at the groups I can see the second group has one post looks like the counting

12:39.160 --> 12:43.040
is working and then it says right here at this post.

12:43.050 --> 12:48.480
If I hit my Poso function I want to delete this.

12:48.630 --> 12:49.680
Looks like it's working.

12:49.680 --> 12:52.070
I'm going to cancel and see that it redirects here.

12:52.140 --> 12:55.680
OK so it looks like we're able to post but notice that we're not getting a lot of the functionality

12:55.680 --> 13:00.660
we thought we were going to get things like the date that the post was created that or my Jose isn't

13:00.660 --> 13:05.520
actually linking to my profile and it's probably because we forgot to put some things either on this

13:05.520 --> 13:10.070
particular template page or one of the templates It extends from or injects into.

13:10.260 --> 13:18.300
So let's go back to our editor and you'll notice that for this page that would have been the user post

13:18.330 --> 13:20.160
page or the Post confirmed.

13:20.900 --> 13:23.190
Fact if we go back this is post by Jose.

13:23.190 --> 13:29.090
Number three is actually the post detail page so posts underscore detail if we take a look at it essentially

13:29.090 --> 13:30.990
just in Jecks underscore posts.

13:31.020 --> 13:31.860
H m l.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.750
Meaning all the issues are probably within underscore posts.

13:34.770 --> 13:35.520
HTL.

13:35.580 --> 13:40.630
So again coming back here I'm getting some issues at Jose I expect that to be clicking.

13:40.650 --> 13:43.840
I expect this to probably say Jose instead of just Jose.

13:44.040 --> 13:45.270
I don't know what this is doing there.

13:45.270 --> 13:47.090
So there's still some problems here.

13:47.100 --> 13:51.870
Let's come back and this page is directly what we're looking at since there shouldn't be any problems

13:51.870 --> 13:52.090
here.

13:52.110 --> 13:53.430
Just about five lines of code.

13:53.550 --> 13:59.040
It's probably all an underscore post that takes him out so we'll go to underscore postdates HTML and

13:59.040 --> 14:00.330
add some stuff in here.

14:00.420 --> 14:01.980
The collapse is their victory tree.

14:02.160 --> 14:08.680
It looks like we actually forgot to add in the text for these anchor tags which was probably a big oversight.

14:08.820 --> 14:10.450
So let's do that now.

14:10.530 --> 14:15.080
Underneath media heading these anchor tags should probably have something since they're linking to something.

14:15.270 --> 14:19.750
So we will say at and then this will be the username.

14:19.790 --> 14:27.440
So I will say postop user the user name save that let's go back and see if that affected something.

14:27.730 --> 14:27.970
OK.

14:27.970 --> 14:33.080
So there you see Jose and I don't really want this double Jose there so we'll come back here.

14:33.310 --> 14:36.610
And then let's get rid of this so post user post username.

14:36.640 --> 14:40.810
I'm going to just comment that out because I feel like I don't really need it now.

14:40.810 --> 14:42.580
There we go so let's look looking a little better.

14:42.580 --> 14:43.670
Come back up here.

14:43.810 --> 14:48.140
And looks like the time isn't actually posting so let's do something there as well.

14:48.220 --> 14:54.250
Insert here or inject post created at.

14:54.250 --> 14:59.680
Remember those that property over time was created that save it and then I'm going to refresh.

14:59.950 --> 15:00.550
OK.

15:00.550 --> 15:03.290
Looks like we have creation Jose.

15:03.410 --> 15:04.390
That's looking good.

15:04.390 --> 15:07.120
We see that we still have this weird esque floating around there.

15:07.180 --> 15:09.490
And if I refresh this page it's still there.

15:09.540 --> 15:11.440
I can see it it's after the delete button.

15:11.590 --> 15:16.200
So I try to confirm that it's an underscore post or if it's actually in the user post list.

15:16.240 --> 15:25.450
So coming back here if I type something outside of this this is outside underscore post save that and

15:25.450 --> 15:28.860
then refresh this page looks like that happens.

15:28.870 --> 15:34.300
So outside underscore post which means this s is not part of the injection itself.

15:34.580 --> 15:38.290
So that means the problem is not actually an underscore postdated demo.

15:38.390 --> 15:41.740
So I'll save that and it should have been under user post list.

15:41.750 --> 15:47.720
So clicking on user posts list I can see include and whip's looks like S was right here the whole time.

15:47.720 --> 15:48.730
Delete that s.

15:48.800 --> 15:49.880
Save this.

15:49.880 --> 15:50.960
Come back here.

15:50.960 --> 15:51.840
Refresh the page.

15:51.860 --> 15:54.170
And now the S has gone looking good.

15:54.170 --> 15:58.910
If I come back to start social that takes me to walk on the start social I can see a list of groups

15:58.940 --> 16:04.820
first group second group and it looks like everything is working let's try creating a new user going

16:04.820 --> 16:08.310
through all the actions and then verifying that everything is working.

16:08.360 --> 16:11.300
So I will log out says Thanks for visiting come back soon.

16:11.310 --> 16:16.390
Let's sign up actually before we do that let's see if we can view the groups without being logged in.

16:16.550 --> 16:17.270
That's looking good.

16:17.270 --> 16:20.240
First group no post in this group yet hit the groups over here.

16:20.240 --> 16:22.880
There's one post and second group and there's the post itself.

16:22.910 --> 16:26.740
OK that's looking pretty good then I'm going to sign up.

16:26.990 --> 16:28.420
Will sign up as new.

16:28.420 --> 16:33.050
Underscore user new shemale dot com.

16:33.080 --> 16:34.750
This will be a test password.

16:36.120 --> 16:37.910
Test password.

16:37.940 --> 16:38.970
Sign up.

16:39.290 --> 16:45.080
OK so I have new underscore user and I the same phosphorus Joses will just log in.

16:45.230 --> 16:52.220
Ok now it says I'm logged in perfect and going to try to create a group and this will take me to my

16:52.460 --> 16:53.370
new groups.

16:53.390 --> 16:58.100
Make it really obvious brand new create.

16:58.130 --> 17:00.960
Ok so my new group member count no posts in this group yet.

17:01.000 --> 17:04.850
Then again I am pretty zoomed in here so that's why it looks a little weird.

17:04.880 --> 17:08.240
I'm going to join my own group and Elosha posting it.

17:08.570 --> 17:18.110
So this is the first post in the group and then I'll go to my new group post and there it is.

17:18.110 --> 17:24.130
This is the first post a new group new user interface a new user takes me to the same page.

17:24.140 --> 17:25.340
So let's try exploring.

17:25.340 --> 17:32.630
If I go to groups the second group that had a post buy at Home sales try looking at Jose and I can see

17:32.780 --> 17:37.730
Jose's profile essentially it's like his profile or Twitter feed and I can see whatever post that this

17:37.730 --> 17:38.830
person has done.

17:38.900 --> 17:39.520
Perfect.

17:39.560 --> 17:43.940
So it looks like all our functionality is working up coming up next.

17:43.950 --> 17:45.950
We have to do is set up our CSSA files.

17:45.950 --> 17:50.000
Kind of give this a nicer look OK we'll do that in the next lecture.

17:50.000 --> 17:50.660
I'll see you there.
