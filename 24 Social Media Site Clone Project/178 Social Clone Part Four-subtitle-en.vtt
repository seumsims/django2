00:05.880 --> 00:09.840
Welcome back everyone to the part of the social clone project.

00:10.020 --> 00:12.080
We're going to finish up the accounts application.

00:12.090 --> 00:17.610
That means our log in log out and sign up capabilities by setting up the log in and log out your calls

00:17.700 --> 00:23.090
and or setting up py file creating two more templates for that and then we'll also set up the migration.

00:23.100 --> 00:27.960
So we're going to continue with the accounts application right where we left off from the previous lecture.

00:27.960 --> 00:28.200
OK.

00:28.200 --> 00:29.940
Here I am Adam text editor.

00:29.960 --> 00:33.860
Remember in the previous lecture we finished off creating are based studies team M-file.

00:33.870 --> 00:39.540
What we need to do is set up the log in to redirect your URL and log out redirect you RL that the log

00:39.540 --> 00:44.310
in and log out views are going to call and we're going to need to do that within our settings that PI

00:44.310 --> 00:44.880
file.

00:45.090 --> 00:47.690
So go to simple social settings not pi.

00:48.060 --> 00:51.450
And then these usually go all the way at the bottom so scroll all the way down and we're going to set

00:51.450 --> 00:53.680
up two variables.

00:54.060 --> 00:59.730
So you're going to say log in underscore redirects underscore you are l.

00:59.730 --> 01:05.190
So this is the log in redirect and we'll have this redirect to a test page and then we will have our

01:05.190 --> 01:11.830
log out underscore read redirect underscore you Earl and I'm going to have that be equal to A thinks

01:11.910 --> 01:12.470
page.

01:12.540 --> 01:13.730
So we'll save that.

01:14.040 --> 01:18.750
And now that we've said test and thinks let's actually create those templates so we didn't create those

01:18.750 --> 01:24.500
templates inside of our top level templates in the same directory we're based on index trees.

01:24.510 --> 01:30.180
Tim L-R so we'll a new file and I'm going to call this file test.

01:30.320 --> 01:33.500
H.A. and I'll create one more file under templates.

01:33.500 --> 01:39.450
New file and I will say thanks to HTL and let's set those up so the test.

01:39.460 --> 01:41.120
I was going to test this.

01:41.130 --> 01:49.500
Basically we're going to say extends from base but each T.M. we're going to say block the content block

01:50.130 --> 01:52.890
and put this inside of a can actually going into a container.

01:52.890 --> 02:01.350
We just need to say H-1 you are now logged in exclamation point and then we'll just actually just have

02:01.350 --> 02:02.250
that be it.

02:02.250 --> 02:05.590
So I'll save that that's essentially going to be a test page to see if logging in worked.

02:05.700 --> 02:08.690
Once you log in it should take us this page you are now logged in.

02:08.910 --> 02:12.930
And then in our thinks each team pile this is going to be the log out.

02:12.930 --> 02:24.000
So we'll say extends based HCM HTL I will call the content block here and then we'll say H-1.

02:24.230 --> 02:28.840
Thanks for visiting comeback soon.

02:28.940 --> 02:32.480
That's kind of the typical log out thing you usually see in a web site.

02:32.510 --> 02:35.750
So if you log out of Facebook usually see oh thank you for visiting.

02:35.750 --> 02:36.400
Come back soon.

02:36.410 --> 02:37.020
Cetera.

02:37.250 --> 02:42.530
So that's our log in and log out so log in view from jingo point eleven essentially going to look for

02:42.530 --> 02:45.870
those variables which are then going to connect to these HCM files.

02:45.920 --> 02:51.410
So now that we created those HMO files what we need to do is actually set them up with the views that

02:51.410 --> 02:55.110
pi and euros that PI over a simple social app.

02:55.160 --> 03:02.390
So in the simple social project come over to views that pie right now we just have our home page view.

03:02.390 --> 03:10.440
I'm going to add in the test page and the things page I will say class test page and I'm going to again

03:10.440 --> 03:19.440
use template view here and then just set my template name equal to test page T.M. and I'll add one more

03:19.980 --> 03:21.360
for the actual thinks page.

03:21.360 --> 03:24.150
So will say thanks page.

03:24.180 --> 03:31.530
And this is going to be a template view and this will say template name is equal to think study.

03:31.580 --> 03:33.180
Female perfect.

03:33.190 --> 03:37.170
Now I'm going to say that since we have these interviews we're going to connect these two or you're

03:37.170 --> 03:38.100
all stopped by.

03:38.190 --> 03:40.410
So let's do that come over to your All-Starr pie.

03:40.590 --> 03:47.190
This is our project your PI file and we will say you are el and WIPs you are ill.

03:47.940 --> 03:50.440
And then we're going to use regular expressions here.

03:50.670 --> 03:53.930
We will say something like carrots.

03:54.140 --> 03:56.630
Let's actually make sure we have that in our accounts as well.

03:56.700 --> 03:58.040
That should always be there.

03:58.140 --> 04:04.700
So our curate counts carried accounts and then curate this will be for the test page support slash.

04:04.910 --> 04:09.630
And then I can put a dollar sign in there just to continue in case we want to build off test.

04:09.630 --> 04:21.380
I will say views that test page dot as View so call as a view and then let's give it the name test.

04:23.180 --> 04:31.930
And then we'll say you are all using regular expressions again carrots and then I'm going to say thanks

04:32.980 --> 04:39.940
and let's connect that to use the the thinks page as a view and we'll get the name.

04:40.040 --> 04:44.960
Thanks ok save that.

04:44.980 --> 04:46.740
So now are your patterns are done.

04:46.960 --> 04:51.930
Let's move on to the next step which is to migrate all the changes we did to accounts.

04:52.180 --> 05:01.760
So I will say Python managed PI make migrations accounts and turn let that run great.

05:01.770 --> 05:08.830
We created the model user Nangle and say Python managed up-I migrate enter and we should see it should

05:08.830 --> 05:10.290
have apply those migrations.

05:10.480 --> 05:12.070
Let's check and see if this actually works.

05:12.070 --> 05:13.870
We may have to do some debugging.

05:13.870 --> 05:19.180
We will say Python is up high and then run our server.

05:19.670 --> 05:21.210
Enter.

05:21.290 --> 05:22.940
OK so we got no bugs there.

05:23.060 --> 05:25.950
So we may have to do a little debugging but right now looking good.

05:25.950 --> 05:31.420
I'm going to hop over to the browser in here and the browser let's refresh and see what we get.

05:31.610 --> 05:32.150
OK.

05:32.380 --> 05:34.240
So it says template syntax error.

05:34.300 --> 05:38.940
Invalid block line 17 static that you forget to register or load the tag.

05:38.950 --> 05:39.850
I probably did.

05:39.850 --> 05:45.010
So let's make sure it's actually registered and we can see or hear that's happening at base that T.M.

05:45.100 --> 05:46.390
error at line 17.

05:46.390 --> 05:48.220
So let's fix that.

05:48.340 --> 05:51.070
So I will go back to my base that each team l file.

05:51.070 --> 05:54.640
So let me come back here and here in my base study C.M. file.

05:54.640 --> 05:59.640
I can see him using static but in order to actually use that static call you need to load static files

05:59.770 --> 06:03.590
scroll all the way back up here and right underneath this dock type.

06:03.670 --> 06:12.440
I'm going to call load as a template tag and then say static files save that and balustrades again.

06:12.450 --> 06:13.710
Welcome back to the browser.

06:14.970 --> 06:18.600
Let's refresh and it says Welcome to our social.

06:18.600 --> 06:21.720
OK looking pretty good right now we can see we have the basic navigation bar.

06:21.800 --> 06:25.010
We have our social groups log in and sign up.

06:25.010 --> 06:29.570
So right now groups shouldn't really do anything but log in and sign up should Let's practice signing

06:29.570 --> 06:34.240
up will click sign up and you can see here it actually looks really nicely formatted.

06:34.310 --> 06:39.030
Here you can see there's extra stuff about the password and then required 150 characters or fewer.

06:39.050 --> 06:41.510
That's what bootstrap 3 library is doing for us.

06:41.510 --> 06:43.140
It's making this really nice display.

06:43.310 --> 06:44.270
So let's sign up.

06:44.270 --> 06:49.320
I'm going to say my display name is test user.

06:49.730 --> 06:59.520
My email address is going to be test at gmail dot com password is going to be password and then we will

06:59.520 --> 07:03.360
confirm our password with test password.

07:03.440 --> 07:05.340
Let's click sign up.

07:05.540 --> 07:09.640
OK so it's signed up and redirected us the log in page as we expected.

07:09.710 --> 07:14.120
And it kind of auto filled for me because I'm using Chrome right now which is kind of memorizing the

07:14.210 --> 07:15.100
username password.

07:15.110 --> 07:20.990
So let's make sure this is working and the log in and it says please correct username so it's wrong

07:20.990 --> 07:22.610
username it should be.

07:22.610 --> 07:26.940
Test User and then make sure that password is also correct.

07:26.940 --> 07:28.760
Test password.

07:29.130 --> 07:33.740
Ok now I'm going to log in and then boom it says now you're a log then perfect.

07:33.840 --> 07:36.520
And I can see here the actual navigation bars change.

07:36.510 --> 07:38.550
Now I have post in create group.

07:38.550 --> 07:39.740
I also have log out.

07:39.780 --> 07:42.550
So let's test with log out make sure that's working.

07:42.630 --> 07:44.730
And it says thinks or isn't it come back soon.

07:44.730 --> 07:45.300
Fantastic.

07:45.300 --> 07:50.460
Looks like everything is working for us so we're going to do it in the next lecture we'll continue on

07:50.700 --> 07:55.210
by moving to posts and groups and we kind of have to work with those simultaneously.

07:55.440 --> 07:58.460
So we're not going to work on a single application like we just did here.

07:58.530 --> 08:03.870
But since they're so connected it should be relatively straightforward as far as working with them in

08:03.870 --> 08:04.560
sync.

08:04.740 --> 08:08.150
OK I'm going to end it here and I'll see you at the next lecture.

08:08.310 --> 08:09.380
Thanks everyone.
