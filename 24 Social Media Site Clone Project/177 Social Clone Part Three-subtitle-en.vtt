WEBVTT

00:05.680 --> 00:09.580
Welcome back everyone to part three of the social cloning project.

00:09.610 --> 00:13.990
Now we're going to continue with the accounts application and we're going to do now is focus on setting

00:13.990 --> 00:17.030
up our temple HVM elf files for the log page.

00:17.140 --> 00:22.350
The sign up page as well as connecting that to our actual index page with the navigation bar.

00:22.540 --> 00:25.540
Let's get started and hop over to the Adam sex ed..

00:25.540 --> 00:27.570
All right here I am at the Adam text editor.

00:27.580 --> 00:33.010
Now before we get started what we're going to be doing is installing a library called Bootstrap 3 for

00:33.010 --> 00:35.340
Django or Django Dasch bootstrap 3.

00:35.530 --> 00:40.970
And what this library does is it formats forms in a really nice way using bootstrap.

00:40.990 --> 00:45.730
So go ahead and in your virtual environment or even in your default if you're not using your virtual

00:45.730 --> 00:56.170
environment say Pipp install jingo Dasch bootstrap 3 lips and then hit enter and let that install.

00:56.170 --> 00:57.270
Now I actually already have it.

00:57.270 --> 01:01.140
So it just set all packages meet the requirements already satisfied.

01:01.210 --> 01:06.110
But for you inside your virtual environment again say Pipp install Shingo dasht bootstrap 3.

01:06.340 --> 01:10.420
So that's something we're going to be using throughout the project to actually just make the forms look

01:10.420 --> 01:11.930
a little nicer.

01:11.980 --> 01:17.710
Now once you've done that going to go ahead and just clear that come over to your settings that py file

01:17.830 --> 01:22.020
and in your settings up-I file scroll all the way down to where it says installed apps.

01:22.030 --> 01:28.280
And here we're going to say is bootstrap theory and then a comma.

01:28.300 --> 01:32.350
So again Pipp install bootstrap 3 and then add it to your installed application.

01:32.380 --> 01:34.470
It will show you in a little bit how to use it.

01:34.480 --> 01:36.330
It's essentially just the two lines of code.

01:36.370 --> 01:41.260
You load it in and then when you call form say bootstrap form right before it and it will actually make

01:41.260 --> 01:44.200
it look a lot nicer in your application.

01:44.200 --> 01:51.360
OK let's come back to our accounts templates in logon to HTL and sign up that each team T.M. we're going

01:51.360 --> 01:56.190
to start off with the Sign-Up parish team L and it's actually going to look really similar to the loggin

01:56.190 --> 01:57.200
that each team L.

01:57.480 --> 02:03.660
So in the sign up page what I'm going to do is say extends and I'm going to extend from base start h

02:03.660 --> 02:06.240
t m l which we're going to work with at the very end of this.

02:06.420 --> 02:14.500
And then the other thing going to do is load bootstrap 3 which is the library just installed so extend

02:14.500 --> 02:20.110
from base storage Timo that we created earlier and then load bootstrap 3 and then we're going to do

02:20.110 --> 02:28.360
is call block content so that content block and then I'm going to create a div of the container class

02:29.230 --> 02:38.820
inside of this I'll have a heading 1 saying Sign up and then I will call a form so inside of this form

02:39.180 --> 02:43.590
I'm just going to have a have a class or even an action because the action is going to be taken care

02:43.590 --> 02:44.420
of by jingo.

02:44.640 --> 02:47.870
And the method should be post and I always like capitalizing it.

02:47.960 --> 02:52.090
It works the same if it's not capitalized but that's just for readability for me.

02:52.170 --> 02:54.900
And inside of this we always need our token.

02:55.170 --> 03:00.150
So you can start typing in C SRF underscore tokin inside a token call like that.

03:00.300 --> 03:06.090
And then the last thing we're going to do is create a form and once you have bootstrap 3 installed you're

03:06.090 --> 03:13.080
going to say is bootstrap underscore form space form and that's going to allow us to actually make this

03:13.080 --> 03:15.710
form look a lot nicer using bootstrap on our Web page.

03:15.810 --> 03:17.390
And that's a bootstrap theory.

03:17.490 --> 03:19.300
You can check out the documentation links for it.

03:19.320 --> 03:22.640
But essentially that's the way we're going to be using it for our project.

03:22.650 --> 03:26.680
And then after that inside this form we're going to have an input button.

03:26.790 --> 03:28.680
It's going to be type submit.

03:28.680 --> 03:31.540
I'll give it a value of Sign-Up.

03:31.590 --> 03:33.970
So that's what it says in the actual button.

03:34.170 --> 03:36.980
It won't have a name but we will give it a class.

03:37.260 --> 03:43.120
Let's give it a class between PTEN the default and save that.

03:43.300 --> 03:50.640
OK then I'm going to select all this of control a and then copy it and bring over my log in that is

03:50.640 --> 03:55.500
HTML file and I'm going to copy and paste this because essentially we're going to be doing something

03:55.500 --> 03:56.850
really similar here.

03:56.850 --> 04:02.490
So I am again going to extend from the base to a small bootstrap 3 block content container but instead

04:02.490 --> 04:11.190
of Sign-Up this is not going to say log in and then save that and then the value over here is going

04:11.190 --> 04:16.470
to be log in and then I'm going to save that.

04:16.780 --> 04:18.070
Okay perfect.

04:18.070 --> 04:23.530
Now let's go ahead and set up our views that PI file and or you are also PI file and the connection

04:23.530 --> 04:24.980
between them.

04:25.060 --> 04:27.710
So coming over to views that pi.

04:27.760 --> 04:32.170
Again this is all under accounts you should already have this from the previous lecture.

04:32.240 --> 04:36.580
Just sign up create view then go over to your PI.

04:37.120 --> 04:39.320
Or if we haven't created yet what we need to do is create it.

04:39.320 --> 04:44.310
So underneath accounts say new file your L's not pi.

04:44.310 --> 04:49.630
So it says new file you are Elle's that PI enter.

04:49.670 --> 04:52.000
And now here we're going to import a couple of things.

04:52.040 --> 05:00.370
I'm going to say from Django configuration that you are L's import are el.

05:00.550 --> 05:12.440
And then I will say from jingo doc contrib dot th authorization in poor views as off underscore the

05:12.480 --> 05:13.260
views.

05:13.480 --> 05:18.610
Now the reason we're doing this is make sure you have jingle one point eleven at least to do this but

05:18.940 --> 05:22.440
jingle one point eleven introduced a log in view and a log out view.

05:22.600 --> 05:25.900
So we actually don't have to take care of those interviews that py file anymore.

05:26.050 --> 05:27.210
Previously we had to do.

05:27.250 --> 05:30.480
Inside of that pi create a log in view and a log out.

05:30.730 --> 05:36.670
Now Gengel one point eleven has taken care of that for us and that's located under the control of a

05:36.730 --> 05:38.030
T-H views.

05:38.170 --> 05:42.850
So I'm going to say import views as authorization views or ATHM underscore views.

05:42.940 --> 05:47.190
So I don't mix it up with my original views which is here.

05:47.350 --> 05:49.710
So I'm saying now from import views.

05:49.720 --> 05:53.600
So this is going to line number three is going to import my own views that py file.

05:53.710 --> 05:59.440
And so I don't mix the authorization views I'm going to import as authorization views and let's set

05:59.440 --> 06:05.800
up our Apennine so we'll call this app name accounts that way in case I ever want to use your old templates

06:06.070 --> 06:10.630
in my base or each time I'll file for example at the navigation bar I can refer to it as the accounts

06:10.630 --> 06:15.510
application and then we'll set up our world patterns list.

06:15.550 --> 06:18.720
So inside IList I will say Yoro.

06:18.940 --> 06:25.330
And then using regular expression I'm going to say log in and out this is we're going to use that new

06:25.330 --> 06:33.310
Gengel one point eleven feature elysÃ©e say off underscore views dots and then the loggin view is the

06:33.310 --> 06:34.420
actual view.

06:34.630 --> 06:40.630
And I'll say as view and that's when you log in every feature of Django one point eleven and then inside

06:40.630 --> 06:43.860
of that I'm actually going to connect it to the template name.

06:43.900 --> 06:53.200
So inside a log in view as view I can say template name is equal to and whoops you can do that.

06:53.200 --> 06:57.580
That's going to be a string and I'll zoom out just a little bit and collapses so we can see the whole

06:57.580 --> 06:58.220
thing.

06:58.540 --> 07:08.220
It's going to be accounts slash log in HTL and I'm going to give it the name equal to log in that's

07:08.220 --> 07:10.300
going to be for you are all templates in the future.

07:10.440 --> 07:13.960
And if you want you can separate us separate this out into more than one line.

07:14.070 --> 07:15.920
Here I'm just writing in one giant line.

07:16.110 --> 07:19.480
But you could just break this up into multiple lines.

07:19.620 --> 07:20.610
So.

07:20.640 --> 07:21.360
All right.

07:21.360 --> 07:27.810
So again this is our logging your you are all connected to log in we call log in view from this authorization

07:27.810 --> 07:31.320
views as View and then pass in the template you want to connect the.

07:31.320 --> 07:36.840
In this case log in each table and give it the name log in for future your templates then a comma here

07:36.840 --> 07:38.400
for our next URL.

07:39.070 --> 07:42.830
And that's going to be pretty similar except it's going to be logged out.

07:43.100 --> 07:53.850
So I will say regular expression log outs dollar sign and then I want authorization views and now I'm

07:53.850 --> 08:03.570
going to ask for the log out you as a view and set the name equal to log out.

08:03.630 --> 08:06.520
Then finally I will have the sign up view.

08:06.520 --> 08:07.620
So the whole way your el

08:10.720 --> 08:20.410
Sign-Up view right there and then from my view is file say views the sign up view it created as a view

08:21.310 --> 08:23.460
and then I will say name is equal to.

08:23.500 --> 08:24.910
I'll just call this site up.

08:25.380 --> 08:25.840
OK.

08:26.110 --> 08:31.330
And now are your PI file inside of our accounts application is ready and just to quickly review what

08:31.330 --> 08:32.320
we just did here.

08:32.500 --> 08:38.260
We're already familiar in putting your L's again in importing contrib off views as authorization to

08:38.260 --> 08:42.370
use so I don't mix it up with my own view is that PI file and that's going to allow me to use these

08:42.460 --> 08:47.010
new features a jingle one point eleven log in view and log out view.

08:47.410 --> 08:52.870
A quick note for log in view you have to connect it to your template name for log out view that has

08:52.930 --> 08:54.490
a default view that we can use.

08:54.490 --> 08:55.990
So that's what we're going to do.

08:56.030 --> 08:58.590
Say lock up you as View and then log out.

08:58.610 --> 09:02.800
That will essentially go back to the home page once you log out and that are sign up we already have

09:02.800 --> 09:03.550
that connected.

09:03.550 --> 09:08.840
So I will say sign up as you name sign up and that's all we have to do for our Urals not py file.

09:09.240 --> 09:09.520
OK.

09:09.520 --> 09:16.420
Now the next step is to actually connect our accounts application to our full project using views in

09:16.420 --> 09:17.110
your L's.

09:17.110 --> 09:25.270
So let's open up our tree and come back to simple social pie and then we're going to connect it via

09:25.300 --> 09:26.350
your else.

09:26.350 --> 09:28.560
So right now I'm in the main project.

09:28.560 --> 09:34.600
You are also not py file and let's fill this in so it actually connects to the log in pages for the

09:34.600 --> 09:41.110
accounts we're going to do is over here I will say your l.

09:41.140 --> 09:48.160
So Creedon and Yunior L and using regular expressions we're going to do is say the counts forward slash

09:49.030 --> 09:56.570
and then we will say include and I'm going to occlude include accounts you are oles so that you are

09:56.570 --> 10:00.740
also file were just made and then give it the name space.

10:00.800 --> 10:07.380
And this actually should go inside include I will give it the name space.

10:08.050 --> 10:15.190
And let's just say accounts here comma and then save that and then the other thing I'm going to do is

10:15.190 --> 10:31.440
say are accounts slash and I'm going to include jingo contrib dash or dot th dot or else OK.

10:31.500 --> 10:34.430
And then comma and we're going to leave that as is.

10:34.650 --> 10:39.720
And that should be it for the actual Your file for connecting to the accounts.

10:39.720 --> 10:46.040
So essentially what this is doing is it's connecting the accounts main space to accounts or else.

10:46.050 --> 10:51.510
That way someone has log in or sign up that connects directly to your Olsdorf PI file that we just created

10:51.930 --> 10:54.210
in the accounts application.

10:54.210 --> 10:58.860
Now this jingoes that contrib the author or else that's going to allow us to connect the thing that

10:58.860 --> 11:01.350
Django has under the hood for authorization.

11:01.350 --> 11:08.460
You'll notice that if we hit over on admen PI undercounts we actually really need to register any models

11:08.460 --> 11:14.610
here because we're using jangles built in use user's model so we don't really need to register anything

11:14.610 --> 11:18.510
with the admin remember with users was already included.

11:18.510 --> 11:23.720
Whenever you log into your adamant page so we're just using what has already nicely provided for us.

11:23.790 --> 11:28.080
Now jump over to our base let each team mail file.

11:28.080 --> 11:32.670
So based on each C.M. all the way under our main templates and essentially what I'm going to be doing

11:32.700 --> 11:37.560
is copying pasting from the notes themselves and explaining each copy paste.

11:37.560 --> 11:45.280
So the first thing I want to do is let's just give this the title of star social save that and then

11:45.340 --> 11:48.770
underneath or inside this head it should say.

11:48.770 --> 11:51.820
And underneath that title I'm going to be copy and pasting some links.

11:51.880 --> 11:54.880
So the first thing I'm going to copy and paste is just bootstrap itself.

11:54.880 --> 11:55.940
So let's put that in.

11:55.990 --> 12:01.240
So there's that giant link for the stylesheet to bootstrap the next one I'm going to do is the optional

12:01.240 --> 12:02.560
theme that goes a bootstrap.

12:02.560 --> 12:04.600
So I'm going to copy and paste that as well.

12:04.600 --> 12:08.860
You can copy and paste this either from the bootstrap site or from the notes themselves.

12:08.860 --> 12:13.040
I'd recommend the notes just so we make sure we're all using the same version or on the same page.

12:13.090 --> 12:20.700
And then finally and going to copy and paste the javascript line that's again also from the bootstrap.

12:20.900 --> 12:21.150
OK.

12:21.160 --> 12:23.270
So those are my three bootstrap blanks.

12:23.290 --> 12:30.400
The other thing that I do is copy and paste a link to a style so the style sheet is going to be linking

12:30.400 --> 12:34.660
to is our own style sheet but also google fonts API.

12:34.930 --> 12:38.490
So we're going to be using this fonts from the Google API.

12:38.560 --> 12:43.550
So as we've seen before I'm just going to link that up in the head and I'm going to link the master

12:43.550 --> 12:44.940
CSSA file.

12:45.340 --> 12:46.930
So let's do that as well.

12:47.020 --> 12:51.200
Underneath this I'm going to link to the M.C. SS.

12:51.340 --> 12:53.980
Now what's important to know is how I'm actually linking this.

12:53.990 --> 12:59.710
You remember that we created a C Ss folder underneath our templates folder and then underneath that

12:59.770 --> 13:04.270
I created the master C Ss file and I'm going to link it using this static call.

13:04.300 --> 13:07.830
So wherever we say that load static I'm going to be able to connect this.

13:07.990 --> 13:10.240
So we just say stylesheet ref.

13:10.270 --> 13:14.800
And this is probably the most important line here as far as getting everything connected will say static

13:14.830 --> 13:16.860
which means go look in the static directory.

13:16.900 --> 13:22.690
So we set up in the settings that py file and then go to simple social C Ss and then master C Ss to

13:22.690 --> 13:24.120
actually link everything.

13:24.370 --> 13:24.880
OK.

13:25.150 --> 13:30.970
Now underneath the body outside of the block I want my actual navigation bar.

13:31.000 --> 13:33.250
So let's actually build this together.

13:33.910 --> 13:42.570
And I will say nav and there's my nav and in my nav I will say class and it will give this a nav bar.

13:42.570 --> 13:44.590
My nav.

13:44.850 --> 13:51.080
And then we can actually just give it the default rules so I'll say this is rule navigation.

13:51.210 --> 13:55.830
You can basically just copy and pasted it from the documentation.

13:56.040 --> 13:59.880
But I want to walk through it just in case you end up copying pacing and are wondering what's going

13:59.880 --> 14:00.530
on here.

14:00.690 --> 14:06.150
So I gave it this class nav bar my nav my nav is something I'm going to be using later on.

14:06.210 --> 14:07.860
So that's my own special navigation.

14:07.950 --> 14:10.310
In case you ever want to add your own CSO styling.

14:10.430 --> 14:18.030
You can do is just kind of tack on classes and then the next thing to do is set up a div here and I'll

14:18.120 --> 14:22.930
call this container from Bootstrap that we've seen before that goes inside nav bar.

14:23.130 --> 14:28.400
And now it's time to add an anchor and the actual link is going to be to our home page.

14:28.530 --> 14:35.020
So we're going to do this with a your all template tagging and we will say you are el and give it the

14:35.020 --> 14:42.190
name home that will link to the Home link and then we're also going to say here let's just say this

14:42.190 --> 14:49.030
will be store social and let's make this into an actual brand which means I'm going to say the class

14:49.090 --> 14:58.750
of this anchor tag is nav bar dash brand and I will tack on my nav class in case everyone at the CSSA

14:58.840 --> 14:59.710
for that.

14:59.710 --> 15:02.220
So again right now my name navigation.

15:02.260 --> 15:03.470
It's all in a container.

15:03.550 --> 15:05.030
I set my brand.

15:05.200 --> 15:08.810
Remember that's that large home button that goes all the way to the left.

15:08.920 --> 15:12.340
And now I'm going to start an unordered list.

15:12.620 --> 15:23.430
And inside this unordered list I will say class is equal to now have nav bar dash nav nav bar dash right.

15:23.450 --> 15:25.460
So kind of right align everything.

15:25.550 --> 15:31.310
And these are going to be just a couple of buttons things that go to a post a group a create group and

15:31.310 --> 15:35.180
a log out page and then a log in page and assign a page.

15:35.180 --> 15:39.320
Now some of these we won't be able to fill it out right away because we haven't actually created them.

15:39.560 --> 15:43.990
So we're going to kind of leave certain links blank and then we'll fill them in later.

15:44.030 --> 15:44.430
OK.

15:44.540 --> 15:49.400
First thing I want to do is I want to check if a user is authenticated so a user object is going to

15:49.400 --> 15:57.830
be returned to this web page so I can actually check using some template tags if the user dot net can

15:57.830 --> 16:03.950
call the is authenticated attribute off of this which means so the user is authenticated they logged

16:03.950 --> 16:04.150
in.

16:04.160 --> 16:05.300
It's been successful.

16:05.600 --> 16:09.830
And we're going to basically see what the actual navigation bar will look like.

16:09.830 --> 16:15.560
So I put in list objects and there's an ordered list an anchor tag here and right now I will leave that

16:15.560 --> 16:19.580
blank as an address but it's actually going to say inside this anchor.

16:19.660 --> 16:23.050
It's just going to be post.

16:23.150 --> 16:25.220
So that means that the users are locked in.

16:25.220 --> 16:28.970
They can then have a little button in their navigation bar that allows them to post something.

16:29.030 --> 16:32.690
The next thing to do is again list anchor tag.

16:32.990 --> 16:35.020
And this will be groups.

16:35.300 --> 16:38.540
So if the user is logged in they'll be able to see the groups again and leave that blank.

16:38.540 --> 16:40.460
We haven't actually created any groups yet.

16:40.490 --> 16:44.870
And then again after a log then I'm going to allow them to create a group.

16:45.170 --> 16:48.350
So we'll have a create group option over there.

16:48.350 --> 16:51.540
And then finally I'm going to have a log out.

16:51.590 --> 16:53.810
So if the user has authenticated that means they are logged in.

16:53.930 --> 16:55.640
So we should probably have a log out button here.

16:55.660 --> 17:01.960
It will say log out and this one I can fill in because I do have a Treffry to go.

17:02.180 --> 17:12.850
So we're going to say for the your template is going to be called to in a string accounts colon log

17:12.850 --> 17:18.130
out and that connects to that your Else up-I which connects to that log up view.

17:18.440 --> 17:23.810
And now I'm ready to do the other options in case my user is not authenticated meaning they haven't

17:23.810 --> 17:24.740
logged in yet.

17:25.130 --> 17:29.060
So else they have a log then I will do the following.

17:29.570 --> 17:32.200
I'll create a group's tag.

17:32.210 --> 17:33.790
So you should still be able to see the groups.

17:33.790 --> 17:34.680
Whoops let me do it.

17:34.670 --> 17:36.360
Tref call in here.

17:36.360 --> 17:38.650
And just type in groups and they're the anchor.

17:38.840 --> 17:41.510
So we still be able to see the groups even if you're not logged in.

17:41.510 --> 17:45.780
That we can just kind of visit as an and not logged in user.

17:46.100 --> 17:56.190
And then the other option we're just going to be either log in or to sign up.

17:56.440 --> 17:58.840
And these actually do have the links right.

17:58.840 --> 17:59.990
So we just create them.

18:00.220 --> 18:07.760
So let's create those here I will say your el accounts log in for this guy.

18:08.040 --> 18:18.640
And then in the H.F. here for the sign up it will say your el accounts sign up save.

18:18.980 --> 18:22.790
And then as always if I have an if statement with templates I need to say.

18:22.790 --> 18:25.080
And if so and if.

18:25.250 --> 18:25.680
OK.

18:25.910 --> 18:29.280
So we're going to be filling this a lot more into your posts in groups created.

18:29.480 --> 18:31.100
But right now we're just using the basics.

18:31.100 --> 18:36.900
I have accounts log out log in and sign up and that ends my unabridged list.

18:37.160 --> 18:41.940
So that should end my navigation bar and then I'll have my content.

18:41.960 --> 18:48.470
And actually I'm going to wrap this content in a class container so I will see a container and then

18:48.470 --> 18:55.550
I'm also going to put in my content which can be a class I later edit in my CSSA file that master C

18:55.550 --> 18:58.120
Ss and let's put the content inside of this.

18:58.260 --> 19:04.580
OK so going all the way down to the bottom we're going to eventually link to our javascript.

19:04.580 --> 19:08.390
Right now we don't have a javascript file that we've been messing around with but we'll take care of

19:08.390 --> 19:08.790
that later.

19:08.790 --> 19:09.880
So let's just save that.

19:10.100 --> 19:12.660
So by now we should have a simple navigation bar.

19:12.680 --> 19:14.710
A lot of the links are just empty.

19:14.840 --> 19:19.940
But we should at least be able to see the empty buttons themselves so we'll see some of that says Post

19:19.940 --> 19:25.220
groups create groups and this will allow us to kind of check if user authentication is working.

19:25.220 --> 19:30.830
So that's our based H.T. mail file and we should already have the index file ready to go.

19:30.860 --> 19:32.530
Since we've done that earlier.

19:32.730 --> 19:33.110
OK.

19:33.140 --> 19:35.030
Our template files should be ready to go.

19:35.030 --> 19:39.260
We still have to do a couple of things such as make them migrations and make sure the accounts are fully

19:39.260 --> 19:39.980
set up.

19:40.010 --> 19:41.760
We're going to do that in the very next lecture.

19:41.780 --> 19:45.110
So I will see you right then and we'll continue on right where we left off here.
