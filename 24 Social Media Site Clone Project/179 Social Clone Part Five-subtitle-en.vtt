Hello everyone and welcome to part five of the social club project.

00:10.460 --> 00:16.480
Now we're going to begin by setting up the views your and template files for the groups and post applications.

00:16.550 --> 00:20.810
And given that they're interconnected we're going to have to work with them concurrently so we can't

00:20.810 --> 00:22.970
just do posts first and then groups first.

00:22.970 --> 00:26.540
Otherwise it won't make too much sense so I have to do both at the same time.

00:26.570 --> 00:30.150
We'll try to keep a focus primarily on one application at a time.

00:30.170 --> 00:33.340
But keep in mind we're going to be working on both at the same time.

00:33.470 --> 00:37.070
We're going to start off by just setting up the files we need and then the next lecture will actually

00:37.070 --> 00:38.110
start programming.

00:38.330 --> 00:44.180
OK let's suppose that a text editor and create the directories and files all right to begin actually

00:44.180 --> 00:45.290
creating the directories.

00:45.310 --> 00:52.160
I first need actually make the applications so we will go to jingo admin and say Star app and it will

00:52.160 --> 00:54.170
create the post application.

00:54.560 --> 01:01.160
So say start out for posts and then I will say jingo dash admen star app and I will start the groups

01:01.190 --> 01:04.610
app so we'll will say group say you could call groups whatever you want.

01:04.610 --> 01:09.870
You could call it something like subeditors or communities etc. I'll just choose the groups they insist

01:09.870 --> 01:11.720
that's pretty simple.

01:11.810 --> 01:14.450
Now we're all going to do it inside each of these.

01:14.460 --> 01:19.370
Let me kind of collapse accounts and collapse simple social and expand and expand groups.

01:19.370 --> 01:21.150
We are going to create the files necessary.

01:21.170 --> 01:26.410
So let's start off with posts so in posts we're going to make templates.

01:26.570 --> 01:33.350
So instead of post I will say new folder and then say templates hit enter and then inside of templates

01:33.380 --> 01:39.170
I'm going to create a new folder called posts and then here are my posts templates and I'm actually

01:39.170 --> 01:41.870
going to create the empty H-how files for now.

01:42.170 --> 01:43.640
So let's start off with that.

01:43.730 --> 01:46.630
We will say whoops that new folder in your file.

01:46.760 --> 01:54.080
So inside of this I'm going to create a couple of new files one will be my base h team l file for my

01:54.080 --> 02:01.910
post which I'll call post underscore base that each T.M. and then I also create a post underscore confirm

02:02.210 --> 02:08.540
underscore deletes but each T.M. they'll be the view that you will confirm and then we're also going

02:08.540 --> 02:09.020
to do.

02:09.020 --> 02:11.270
Let me expand this just a little bit.

02:11.270 --> 02:14.890
We're also going to do a post detail so you can kind of tell.

02:14.900 --> 02:18.340
I'm already kind of thinking of class based views right now.

02:18.340 --> 02:25.630
You will see a post underscore detail thought HTL and then a couple more here.

02:26.990 --> 02:32.620
We'll create a post form so when someone actually wants to type out the post to go to that post form

02:33.010 --> 02:38.480
and then if we want to actually list the full list view I will create a post underscore list that each

02:38.510 --> 02:44.270
T.M. And then finally we'll create a new file and this will be called user underscore.

02:44.580 --> 02:46.150
Post underscore list.

02:46.220 --> 02:48.950
And if you click on a user we should see all their posts.

02:48.950 --> 02:54.210
Kind of like seeing someone's Twitter feed so we'll have user underscore posting or score list.

02:54.290 --> 02:58.610
Now we're also going to create one more file in a format that we haven't really seen before and that's

02:58.620 --> 03:05.060
the underscore post-START T.M. And the reason for that is I'm actually going to use this underscore

03:05.070 --> 03:09.990
postdates html file to inject it into other posts that HTL files.

03:10.100 --> 03:16.550
Sometimes if you're single it's team elth page or your simple template is actually getting too big and

03:16.550 --> 03:17.900
overly complicated.

03:17.900 --> 03:20.520
Sometimes you can just break it up and inject it.

03:20.570 --> 03:22.200
And I'll show you how to do that later on.

03:22.200 --> 03:27.440
But right now we'll just keep that thought in our heads and will keep underscore postdates T.M. as are

03:27.440 --> 03:32.180
actual templates we have those template files and the next we're going to do is actually create a few

03:32.180 --> 03:34.340
more files inside of posts.

03:34.880 --> 03:41.060
So instead of post right now I have models and views but I'm also going to add a or else top pie any

03:41.060 --> 03:43.430
forms that pie will say.

03:43.430 --> 03:49.950
Post your apply and then impose new file forms that apply.

03:50.130 --> 03:51.930
OK so that's what we're going to do with post for now.

03:51.930 --> 03:56.190
So we created those templates and you can always just copy and paste the templates or check out the

03:56.190 --> 03:58.940
notes for the directories of what those templates actually look like.

03:59.070 --> 04:01.250
In case you had difficulty following along.

04:01.500 --> 04:04.080
But now we're going to do kind of the same thing for groups.

04:04.080 --> 04:11.260
So in-groups we're going to do now is create that templates that victory I'll say new folder templates

04:11.350 --> 04:18.570
and then under templates I'm going to say new folder groups and then under groups I'm going to create

04:18.570 --> 04:19.400
a couple of each team.

04:19.400 --> 04:24.180
All files will say new file group underscore based studies T.M..

04:24.480 --> 04:30.480
So that would be my base h HTML file for the groups and I will extend from that I'll create a new file

04:30.480 --> 04:38.480
called Group underscore detail each T.M. then I'll create any file group form.

04:38.520 --> 04:42.940
So when someone wants to create a new group to come to this forum page again class based views here.

04:43.200 --> 04:49.500
And then finally we should see a list of all the groups so he will say group underscore listed HTL and

04:49.500 --> 04:50.590
hit enter.

04:50.610 --> 04:57.240
OK so those are my four template files for groups and then I also want to create a profile here so we

04:57.240 --> 05:03.330
will say underneath groups new file you URLs that pie.

05:04.020 --> 05:04.480
OK.

05:04.530 --> 05:06.420
And then save all those changes.

05:06.420 --> 05:07.550
Close these now.

05:07.830 --> 05:13.170
And we should have our basic structure or skeleton for dealing with posts and groups and we're going

05:13.170 --> 05:19.360
to do in the next lecture is start off by actually focusing on groups first since there's fewer team

05:19.520 --> 05:21.300
l files or template files to work with.

05:21.300 --> 05:24.630
And if the structure is going to be a little simpler and that will kind of dictate where we need the

05:24.630 --> 05:25.570
posts to look like.

05:25.590 --> 05:29.310
So we're going to try to focus on groups at first but eventually we're gonna have to work on them both

05:29.310 --> 05:30.020
at the same time.

05:30.030 --> 05:32.870
But to make it a little easier we're going to try to focus on groups.

05:33.030 --> 05:33.390
Okay.

05:33.390 --> 05:35.190
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
