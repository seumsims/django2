Welcome to partake of the social cloning project now we're going to do is connect the views that we've

00:10.860 --> 00:13.120
already created in groups to some murals.

00:13.140 --> 00:17.910
We still have two more views to create in the group's application but we'll worry about those later

00:17.910 --> 00:18.510
on.

00:18.510 --> 00:22.770
Right now we're just going to connect the user created to some Urals and we're also going to register

00:22.770 --> 00:26.650
the group models that we previously created to the admin that PI file.

00:26.880 --> 00:28.830
Let's hop over to Adam and get started.

00:28.830 --> 00:29.070
All right.

00:29.070 --> 00:33.700
Here I am at the text editor I have the model's views and the various templates are created.

00:33.840 --> 00:36.750
What I want to do now is go to your not pie.

00:36.810 --> 00:43.500
This is the groups your URLs up py file and here's where I'm going to basically connect all the views

00:43.500 --> 00:44.730
I just made.

00:44.850 --> 00:53.250
So we will say from Django figuration your Elle's import your L and then I'm also going to save from

00:53.250 --> 00:59.130
Daut import views to actually access the views we just created specifically those class based views

00:59.760 --> 01:06.580
and then we'll get this app name group so we can reference it later on with your template tagging.

01:06.590 --> 01:13.880
Now I'm going to make a list of your all patterns and we're going to say the first pattern is just going

01:14.420 --> 01:18.180
to be the very basic groups page and that will be the list groups page.

01:18.180 --> 01:21.090
So we'll actually just call it carot dollar sign.

01:21.260 --> 01:26.030
So when someone actually goes to your Web site dot com slash groups it shows you the list of all the

01:26.030 --> 01:34.150
groups so say views list groups start as a view and then we'll give the name we can just keep it all

01:36.300 --> 01:43.290
and then we're also going to say your L and for this one this is going to be the Create page so you

01:43.290 --> 01:50.380
can either call it slash create or call it slash new and then we're going to say views and that will

01:50.380 --> 01:53.150
be the create group as a view.

01:54.240 --> 01:55.730
And then we'll see name is create

01:58.840 --> 02:03.900
it will create in other Euro function this is going to be for the actual detail view and it is going

02:03.900 --> 02:04.980
to be a little more complicated.

02:04.980 --> 02:11.280
We're going to do is say PPOs slash and slash and then this will actually be the group and we're going

02:11.280 --> 02:14.760
to use regular expressions to plug in the slug there.

02:14.770 --> 02:15.270
So it goes.

02:15.270 --> 02:22.880
Question mark capital P and then open tag close tag with slug.

02:23.310 --> 02:25.940
And then in brackets here we'll say minus backslash.

02:25.980 --> 02:33.780
There'll be you know we'll say plus And after all of that forward slash dollar sign and Bisco it's just

02:33.990 --> 02:41.160
going to say post in and then it's going to slug ify the actual group name and then that will lead to

02:41.580 --> 02:44.280
the actual single group there.

02:44.280 --> 02:53.250
So there will be views dots and we called that single group will say as a view and we'll give the name

02:53.310 --> 02:59.370
and collapses this we get a little more room which is called This single and save we still have two

02:59.370 --> 03:03.300
more Uriel's and two more views to make about Leni leaving and joining groups.

03:03.300 --> 03:06.900
But right now we don't really worry about them we'll take care of that when we actually create those

03:06.900 --> 03:08.030
views blessing.

03:08.180 --> 03:14.430
I want to do in this particular lecture is assigned the admin file for the models created so remember

03:14.430 --> 03:18.500
previously we created the group model as well as the group member model.

03:18.510 --> 03:24.860
So let's set that up in our admin that pie going to open that up and then go to Evan that pie from jingo.

03:24.870 --> 03:28.290
And then I also want to say from datt import models.

03:28.370 --> 03:37.750
So I want to register these models with the abdomen and I will say Adam in site thought register and

03:37.750 --> 03:45.130
then I just passen models group and then the other thing I want to do is a little special with a tabular

03:45.220 --> 03:52.090
inline and the inline class that we're going to be using basically allows us to utilize the admin interface

03:52.090 --> 03:56.790
and or Gengel Web site with the ability to edit models on the same page as the parent model.

03:56.950 --> 04:02.620
So our group member basically has a bit of a parent model with group and what we can do is we can use

04:02.650 --> 04:07.710
a tabular inline class so that when we visit the admin page I can click on group and then see the group

04:07.780 --> 04:09.440
members and edit those as well.

04:09.450 --> 04:10.840
So let's see how we can do that.

04:10.870 --> 04:20.420
All I need to do is say class group member and then I'm going to say in line then I call in tabular

04:20.420 --> 04:29.180
in line and then I just do the assignment of model is equal to models group member and then I don't

04:29.180 --> 04:35.720
actually have to register it because now the group member model is in line here and we'll see what that

04:35.720 --> 04:40.280
looks like with more detail when we actually it is the Adamant site and that's all we're going to do

04:40.280 --> 04:41.090
for this lecture.

04:41.090 --> 04:45.350
Just connecting the views we've previously created in our Urals the py file which you can reference

04:45.350 --> 04:51.590
in the notes as well as set up our registration for the models so the group model is just typical registration.

04:51.590 --> 04:55.730
And then here we did a type inline which you're going to see later on when we actually visit the admin

04:55.730 --> 04:56.380
page.

04:56.550 --> 04:57.160
OK.

04:57.350 --> 04:58.880
So much shorter than the last one.

04:58.880 --> 05:00.340
So take your time with this.

05:00.350 --> 05:04.760
Definitely a lot of stuff to type out and you can always copy and paste from the notes.

05:04.790 --> 05:06.590
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
