Hello everyone and welcome back.

00:07.290 --> 00:11.120
It's time for a challenge lecture to put your new skills to the test.

00:11.930 --> 00:17.120
We've learned enough now that before we continue to learn more about your Ehle mappings we should challenge

00:17.120 --> 00:19.670
you to make sure you can test out your new skills.

00:20.450 --> 00:22.840
A watch to complete the following tasks.

00:22.930 --> 00:30.190
First create a new Gengel project and call it something like pro to or project to then create a new

00:30.190 --> 00:31.610
Gengel application.

00:31.820 --> 00:37.300
You can call it app to or application too and this will go inside that new jingle project that I want

00:37.300 --> 00:42.940
you to create an index view inside of that new Django application and I want you to have it return this

00:42.940 --> 00:43.760
line.

00:43.780 --> 00:47.050
My second app wraps in emphasis tags.

00:47.230 --> 00:49.900
So note that this is actual HVM Melk code.

00:49.900 --> 00:53.920
The reason I'm asking you to do this is because I want you to explore what happens when you actually

00:54.250 --> 01:01.610
a string of HLL code instead of just a normal string that I want you to link that you'd that your stock

01:01.630 --> 01:07.780
price file and run your server to make sure it actually returned that new index you created.

01:09.100 --> 01:13.120
Then the next lecture were going to go through the steps of this challenge task.

01:13.120 --> 01:14.030
Best of luck.

01:14.080 --> 01:19.060
I know you already have all the knowledge needed to complete this task but in case you get stuck on

01:19.060 --> 01:24.550
anything you can refer back to the previous lectures or you can view the upcoming solutions lecture.

01:24.550 --> 01:26.580
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
