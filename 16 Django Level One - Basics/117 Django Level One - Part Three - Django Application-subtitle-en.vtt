00:05.280 --> 00:10.080
Hello everyone and welcome back in this lecture we're going to be discussing how to create our first

00:10.140 --> 00:16.860
Django application with a very simple view so far we've been able to use run server to test our installation

00:16.860 --> 00:17.880
of Django.

00:17.880 --> 00:20.920
Now let's move on to actually creating our first Django application.

00:20.940 --> 00:22.770
We'll learn about views and how to use them.

00:23.910 --> 00:28.950
Let's get some terminology straight though before we continue the Gengel project is a collection of

00:28.950 --> 00:34.830
applications and configurations that when combined together is going to make up the full web application

00:34.860 --> 00:38.360
or Web site that's your complete Web site running with Django.

00:38.460 --> 00:43.860
A lot of times people use the term Web application to describe a Web site so try not to get it confused

00:43.920 --> 00:45.630
with a single application.

00:46.400 --> 00:53.370
A Django application is created to perform a particular functionality for your entire web application.

00:53.390 --> 01:00.020
So for example you could have a registration Gengel application or a pulling Gengel application comments

01:00.010 --> 01:01.150
jingo application.

01:01.310 --> 01:03.550
So pulling app comments et cetera.

01:04.160 --> 01:09.830
These Django apps are Jinggoy applications can then be plugged into other Django projects so you can

01:09.830 --> 01:10.420
reuse them.

01:10.430 --> 01:14.670
Or more importantly use other people's Gengel applications.

01:14.720 --> 01:20.930
This process of being able to take a single application and plug it into another Django project Leitz

01:20.960 --> 01:25.130
the terminology of pluggable Django applications.

01:25.190 --> 01:30.270
Ok let's continue on by creating a simple application with the following command.

01:30.320 --> 01:32.640
We'll go back and use that managed up-I File.

01:32.660 --> 01:38.400
We're going to be using it a lot throughout the course and I will say Python managed up Pie star app

01:38.480 --> 01:40.240
and then first underscore app.

01:40.280 --> 01:44.070
So within a Django project we're creating a Django application.

01:44.180 --> 01:46.580
We're going to jump to Adam to get started.

01:46.590 --> 01:46.870
All right.

01:46.880 --> 01:53.630
Here I am back at the Adam text editor and right now I'm located under the first project directory that

01:53.630 --> 01:55.130
top level directory.

01:55.130 --> 01:59.210
And you notice you also get this D-B sequel lights 3.

01:59.570 --> 02:04.380
When we ran our server from last time we can just let it be for now and ignore it.

02:04.430 --> 02:11.060
We want to do is we offer a virtual environment activated actually create that first simple Django application.

02:11.800 --> 02:17.020
So I'm going to type is python managed not pie.

02:17.370 --> 02:23.240
And then the keyword here is start at and then whatever you want to call this first application since

02:23.240 --> 02:29.210
you're doing something really basic like a hello world type app I'm just going to say first underscore

02:29.680 --> 02:37.400
app hit enter and you'll notice that we now get this first app inside of our first project directory.

02:37.410 --> 02:39.960
So this is a Django application.

02:39.960 --> 02:44.780
You'll see that it looks kind of similar to what we had when we actually ran our first project.

02:44.910 --> 02:51.410
Well we get some different files here we get views test models apps admen and in it lets discuss what

02:51.450 --> 02:59.260
all of these files stand for and how they all work to jump back to the presentation.

02:59.300 --> 03:02.810
OK so we created all those files with that start app command.

03:02.840 --> 03:05.230
Now lets discuss what all these files are for.

03:06.100 --> 03:11.560
Here we have another in it that PI file not serving the exact same purpose as we discussed previously

03:11.600 --> 03:17.020
is the blank Python script that due to its special name lets Python know that the rectory can be treated

03:17.020 --> 03:20.940
as a package then we have the admin pie.

03:21.140 --> 03:25.850
And this is where you can register your models so that you can benefit from some Gengel machinery that

03:25.850 --> 03:32.180
basically creates an adamant interface for you and later on will see how fantastic the built in admin

03:32.180 --> 03:33.800
features of Django are.

03:33.800 --> 03:41.270
Its a really powerful tool and its all built into Django and we have the apps that py file that essentially

03:41.270 --> 03:47.700
provides a place for any application specific configuration that we have the models not pie.

03:47.810 --> 03:52.040
And this is going to be a place to store your applications data models and that's where you're going

03:52.040 --> 03:57.110
to specify the entities and relationships between the data and don't make a lot more sense when we actually

03:57.110 --> 03:58.850
begin to play with that file.

03:59.670 --> 04:04.590
Then we have the test PI file and this is where you can store a series of functions to test out your

04:04.590 --> 04:10.830
applications code then we have views up high which is where you can store a series of functions that

04:10.830 --> 04:14.790
handle requests and return responses.

04:14.810 --> 04:20.240
Then finally we have that migrations directory or migrations folder and this directory stores database

04:20.240 --> 04:23.860
specific information as it relates to the models.

04:23.930 --> 04:30.200
So the used up PI and the models that pie are the two files you're going to be using for any given application

04:30.770 --> 04:37.430
and the form part of that main architectural design pattern employed by jingo is the model view template

04:37.460 --> 04:38.010
pattern.

04:38.060 --> 04:43.220
And you can check out the official Gengel documentation to see how models views and templates all relate

04:43.220 --> 04:45.360
to each other in a lot more detail.

04:45.370 --> 04:49.790
So before we get started with any of this we actually need to tell Django that we just created this

04:49.880 --> 04:56.060
application we need to let it know that first underscore app actually exists so it will do is go back

04:56.060 --> 05:02.930
to the settings that py file of our project and add in that first app then once Shingo knows about the

05:02.930 --> 05:08.220
application's existence we can learn the process of creating a view and mapping it to our your l.

05:08.240 --> 05:13.760
To complete this entire process let's jump back to the Adam text editor and do all of these tasks.

05:14.080 --> 05:20.210
OK here and back Adam text editor and what I want to do is check out this setting up PI that was created

05:20.210 --> 05:21.740
when we first created our project.

05:21.740 --> 05:25.910
And again these are the jingoes settings for the first project project.

05:25.940 --> 05:28.950
If we scroll down we'll see a bunch of variables.

05:29.000 --> 05:35.150
The one we're looking for is called installed apps and here they are we see installed apps and it's

05:35.270 --> 05:41.690
essentially what a list is with some string application definitions and what we need to do is add in

05:41.690 --> 05:42.740
our own application.

05:42.740 --> 05:49.070
This first underscore that you can see here that Django automatically adds its own default apps like

05:49.160 --> 05:52.360
authorization administration apps messages etc..

05:52.490 --> 05:56.220
Static files all of which are going to be discussing in future lectures.

05:56.220 --> 06:04.340
Right now let's add in as a string that application we just created which is first underscore app and

06:04.340 --> 06:10.370
then what we will do is save this I can just do control S. to save that and that's saved.

06:10.390 --> 06:15.190
Adam what's nice is we'll be a little blue dot here to let you know that you haven't saved it yet to

06:15.190 --> 06:17.080
make sure all of this actually worked.

06:17.080 --> 06:21.630
We're just going to run the server again one more time and make sure we have no errors.

06:21.760 --> 06:31.360
So I will say Python space managed up pine and then selects that run server command center.

06:31.410 --> 06:35.360
And as long as I don't get any errors then everything should be working fine.

06:35.380 --> 06:37.940
I can just copy and paste this into a browser.

06:37.940 --> 06:41.470
Whoops looks like I did control C which makes sense.

06:41.470 --> 06:42.550
Let's run that again.

06:43.280 --> 06:50.710
And I should Right-Click this so I like the copy and I'm going to put it into a browser and make sure

06:50.770 --> 06:55.240
it's working and you can see here that I have put it into a browser on my other screen and to drag it

06:55.240 --> 06:57.880
over real quick and we see that everything is still working.

06:57.970 --> 07:05.740
Good that means the first app is working fine on the installed apps so I will do Control-C to exit out

07:05.740 --> 07:07.400
of that.

07:07.590 --> 07:11.320
The next step that we want to do is actually create a view.

07:11.320 --> 07:17.310
So now that our first app application has been created Well we can do is create a simple view and for

07:17.310 --> 07:22.180
a very first few We're going to just send some back some simple tasks like a hello world.

07:22.180 --> 07:26.360
We won't concern ourselves of actually using models or templates just yet.

07:26.380 --> 07:28.760
We're going to discuss that in a future lecture.

07:28.900 --> 07:36.770
So what you'll do is open up the views of Pi right here and this is under our meat.

07:36.910 --> 07:39.340
Minimize this is under application folders.

07:39.340 --> 07:44.090
We have used up PI and it says from Jingo that shortcuts import render.

07:44.470 --> 07:47.330
Well we need to do is add in a little bit of code here.

07:47.380 --> 07:59.200
We also need to save from jingo dot h t t p import h TTP response

08:03.220 --> 08:09.970
and then I'm going to create a function called index and that's going to take in request

08:13.390 --> 08:23.370
and then it's going to return HTP response and I'm just going to pass in a stream here that says Hello

08:23.370 --> 08:23.880
world.

08:25.670 --> 08:29.220
OK so let's discuss line by line what's actually happening here.

08:29.230 --> 08:37.420
First we had to import HTP response object from the Django that HTP module and then each new for this

08:37.420 --> 08:43.310
application is going to exist within that used up PI file as its own individual function.

08:43.330 --> 08:49.500
And in this instance we just created one view called index with that index function in each view is

08:49.540 --> 08:51.760
also going to take in at least one argument.

08:52.020 --> 08:57.470
And for that HTP request object since it lives inside that Shango HTP module.

08:57.490 --> 09:03.430
By convention we usually call this the request but again you could actually just call this whatever

09:03.430 --> 09:04.030
you want.

09:04.030 --> 09:05.640
This could be Jil-Lee.

09:05.680 --> 09:07.590
As a variable it really wouldn't matter.

09:07.630 --> 09:10.010
But by convention we call it request.

09:10.360 --> 09:16.480
And you'll notice that regardless of what is passed into this function it returns X to T-P response

09:16.540 --> 09:18.440
and then this text Hello world.

09:18.730 --> 09:23.100
So each view must return in HTP response object.

09:23.230 --> 09:28.690
And this very simple response object just is going to take in a string parameter representing the content

09:28.690 --> 09:29.680
of the page.

09:29.680 --> 09:37.300
So what I can also do is pasand some ASTM L in there which will show later on in order for us to actually

09:37.300 --> 09:39.640
see this view when we're running our server.

09:39.650 --> 09:45.520
But we have to do is map this view to the your Elle's dot py file.

09:45.790 --> 09:53.530
So I will open up here first underscore project and jump here to the your dot PI and open that up and

09:53.530 --> 09:57.120
you see here it tells you some information and actually tells you what to do.

09:57.140 --> 10:02.560
So you want to add an import you say from my app import views which is exactly what we're going to do

10:02.590 --> 10:05.860
except in this case it's not my app it's first app.

10:06.130 --> 10:11.890
So I'm going to scroll down here and you'll notice a what is essentially looking like a list of function

10:11.890 --> 10:21.080
calls to your L and I'm going to add in one more over here and I will say call this your function and

10:21.080 --> 10:25.070
this is where it's going to look a little weird because we're using some regular expressions so you

10:25.070 --> 10:27.520
may want to review those as we go along.

10:27.530 --> 10:31.290
They'll just say are single process free.

10:31.310 --> 10:39.950
There are single quote and then that little Carrot's symbol or Chevron it's also called and then another

10:39.950 --> 10:44.050
single quote and sometimes Adam will automatically posted the quote there.

10:44.060 --> 10:45.240
So just delete it.

10:45.290 --> 10:46.410
So that's the first argument.

10:46.430 --> 10:49.600
It's a regular expression and we'll explain what that actually means in a second.

10:49.700 --> 11:03.340
And then when you pass in the views index what what I need to do is say this from first app import views.

11:03.520 --> 11:07.030
So is it actually doing it saying OK from that first that folder.

11:07.030 --> 11:10.050
Import this views up PI.

11:10.120 --> 11:17.560
And that means here I can say views dots and then call that index function which remember that index

11:17.560 --> 11:21.240
function is inside here used up high.

11:21.250 --> 11:23.310
So that's exactly what's happening here I'm just saying.

11:23.360 --> 11:23.680
OK.

11:23.680 --> 11:28.990
From that first that folder grab views and then from views I can call index.

11:28.990 --> 11:30.890
And then I will name this.

11:31.050 --> 11:39.550
That's the third argument I'll just say name is equal to index and remember to put in a comma here to

11:40.120 --> 11:41.400
finish off that list.

11:42.280 --> 11:50.260
So what this is doing is it's actually mapping that applications view to this your son going to save

11:50.260 --> 11:53.130
this OK with that saved.

11:53.160 --> 11:57.110
Let's actually test that to see if this worked by running our server again.

11:57.210 --> 12:01.560
And then after that in the next lecture we're going to discuss your cell mapping in a lot more detail

12:01.800 --> 12:03.210
and other ways of doing it.

12:03.510 --> 12:09.770
So I'm going to come back up here and say Python managed PI run server.

12:09.960 --> 12:11.270
Enter.

12:11.460 --> 12:17.950
And then in my browser is going to jump back to this you are all going to just copy this.

12:18.010 --> 12:23.280
Put it in my browser and then let's see if it work then you should be doing the same thing and hopefully

12:23.280 --> 12:27.690
if everything worked correctly for you if I bring in my browser you should see something that says hello

12:27.690 --> 12:32.910
world or whatever text you happen to put into that particular view.

12:32.910 --> 12:33.630
All right.

12:33.630 --> 12:37.730
So we just created our first Django application very simple hello world.

12:37.800 --> 12:44.910
But we were able to create that application create that view and actually map it to the U R L into your

12:44.920 --> 12:46.260
Alstom pie file.

12:46.450 --> 12:47.250
OK.

12:47.310 --> 12:53.610
So coming up next we're going to discuss a lot more about your Elle's pie a little more about your mapping

12:53.730 --> 12:58.290
and some other ways to do it that are going to be a little more efficient and a little better.

12:58.290 --> 13:00.270
Thanks everyone and I will see you in the next lecture.
