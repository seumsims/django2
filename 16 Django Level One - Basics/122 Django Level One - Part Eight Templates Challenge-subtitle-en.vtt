Hello everyone and welcome back in this lecture you have a challenge and it's a jingle template challenge.

00:11.620 --> 00:13.720
Templates is a big leap forward for us.

00:13.750 --> 00:18.330
So it's a good time to quickly get some practice using them and we're going to be using your older pro

00:18.330 --> 00:21.530
to project they you created for the previous Shingo challenge.

00:21.670 --> 00:23.190
If you don't have that project anymore.

00:23.230 --> 00:28.360
Just quickly recreate it using the creating project commands and accreting application commands that

00:28.360 --> 00:30.340
we've learned in previous lectures.

00:30.340 --> 00:34.110
Once you have that set up you want to go ahead and complete the following tasks.

00:35.100 --> 00:41.010
Create a template character and connect it to the settings that py file of that new second project.

00:41.010 --> 00:44.680
Then create a new view called help and use.

00:44.670 --> 00:49.290
You are all mapping to render it for any page with the extension slash help.

00:49.290 --> 00:54.630
So again you're going to go to your second project folder create that second new application create

00:54.660 --> 00:55.460
a new view.

00:55.470 --> 00:59.970
So the function within that views that py file and use that you are all mapping that we've learned to

00:59.970 --> 01:03.790
actually create a rendering for any page of the extension slash help.

01:03.900 --> 01:08.470
And then I want you to use template tags to return help page.

01:08.520 --> 01:13.830
So in the templates directory that you made create a new folder and within that folder there should

01:13.830 --> 01:18.930
be something like help that H T.M. and then that should have template and template tags that basically

01:18.930 --> 01:20.460
returns help page.

01:20.520 --> 01:25.290
So just get everything connected so that it's clear that you understand how to use templates to connect

01:25.290 --> 01:31.100
to a view and actually inject code into the template HTL.

01:31.110 --> 01:31.440
All right.

01:31.440 --> 01:33.450
Best of luck with that and the next lecture.

01:33.450 --> 01:35.530
We will briefly code through the solution.

01:35.550 --> 01:37.120
Thanks everyone and I'll see you there.
