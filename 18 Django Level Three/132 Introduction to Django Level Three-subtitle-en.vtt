Hello everyone and welcome to Genger level 3 hopefully you are now excited by the possibilities of the

00:10.760 --> 00:15.740
MTV workflows those models templates and views workflows that we already learned about in jingle of

00:15.740 --> 00:17.400
a one and jingle level too.

00:17.510 --> 00:22.370
But we're still missing a big piece to creating a full web site and that is user input.

00:22.760 --> 00:27.770
In this section we're going to be covering how to use Gengel forms to accept user input and connect

00:27.770 --> 00:31.490
it to the database and your models and then retrieve it later on.

00:31.490 --> 00:32.840
All right let's get started.

00:32.840 --> 00:33.850
I'll see at the next lecture.
