Welcome back everyone and this lecture will learn how to do additional fields.

00:11.110 --> 00:16.080
Currently we can only see one field of our models in the list view on the Admin Page.

00:16.120 --> 00:19.120
We can actually add more fields to view AND ORDER BY.

00:19.120 --> 00:22.700
And again this is also just an easy addition of an attribute in that class.

00:22.690 --> 00:26.670
We've been kind of playing around with the up overs of the editor unsure how to do it.

00:27.360 --> 00:32.190
All right so here we are back at the admin PI file and before we actually added the attribute I want

00:32.190 --> 00:36.300
to show you what it currently looks like when we look at the list view of a particular model and to

00:36.300 --> 00:41.880
bring in over my browser and right now if I don't do any filters or if I show all I can see all the

00:41.880 --> 00:42.520
movies.

00:42.740 --> 00:46.590
So I only see right now movie in this list view of a model.

00:46.860 --> 00:48.300
So bringing that over again.

00:48.510 --> 00:53.880
Let's go ahead and show you the attributes and the attributes quite simple as just list display lists

00:53.970 --> 01:00.020
underscore display and let's go ahead and just copy this list so we display all the fields.

01:00.030 --> 01:03.540
Usually you probably don't want to do this depending on how many fields you have in your model but that

01:03.540 --> 01:04.800
should be enough for us.

01:04.830 --> 01:12.030
We'll save it and then let's bring back our list view page and then I'm going to refresh this and I

01:12.030 --> 01:18.360
can see the really cear the length and the title and the order you put them in the list is the order

01:18.360 --> 01:19.210
they show up.

01:19.230 --> 01:21.470
So I probably want a title over here on the left hand side.

01:21.480 --> 01:26.770
Let's do that as well and move this over and let's go ahead and have title be first.

01:26.790 --> 01:28.510
So don't cut that here.

01:30.760 --> 01:37.720
It's actually his insert title and then remove it over here on the back.

01:37.760 --> 01:38.230
There you go.

01:38.340 --> 01:41.080
So I'm going to save this and now refresh the page.

01:42.830 --> 01:43.450
And I can see.

01:43.460 --> 01:45.230
Title is now here first.

01:45.230 --> 01:50.300
So whatever is first in this column is the one you can click on to go to the detail view page.

01:50.330 --> 01:52.180
So again this is the list view.

01:52.190 --> 01:53.040
Click on one of these.

01:53.060 --> 01:54.700
It shows you the detailed view.

01:55.170 --> 02:00.830
You can also now sort by these guys so you can notice these little kind of pop ups here so you can sort

02:00.830 --> 02:06.200
by really sure just by clicking here on the top column and that's how you can add more fields in your

02:06.200 --> 02:06.740
list for you.

02:06.740 --> 02:07.690
Simple as that.

02:07.700 --> 02:12.230
Again the attribute is just lists underscore display and hopefully now you get the theme of how easy

02:12.230 --> 02:14.050
it is to work with Django admen.

02:14.090 --> 02:16.450
You essentially just create a class here.

02:16.670 --> 02:20.960
Inherit from Adam in that model admin and then add in attributes as you need them.

02:20.960 --> 02:26.840
Things like filtering displaying search fields etc. and then just remember to register that particular

02:26.840 --> 02:27.930
class.

02:27.950 --> 02:30.140
OK thanks everyone and I'll see at the next lecture.
