Welcome back everyone to this lecture on adding filters so we can also add filters for Adam in view

00:12.130 --> 00:17.050
of our models and filters will automatically show up on the right hand side of the view and they will

00:17.050 --> 00:19.460
also auto filter the printing on the data type.

00:19.600 --> 00:22.620
And I'll explain more about that later on.

00:22.620 --> 00:26.280
Keep in mind not every field will be useful as a filter.

00:26.280 --> 00:31.580
Let's explore how to easily create filters for admin views and hop over back to the editor.

00:32.040 --> 00:38.160
OK here I am at my admen PI file and if you notice what we have right now for bring in over my browser

00:38.490 --> 00:41.220
is if I'm selecting videos then check out the movies.

00:41.220 --> 00:46.370
I see a list of movies and I can search them and then I can also add movies here when I want to do is

00:46.380 --> 00:47.760
if we come back to home.

00:47.820 --> 00:54.270
Notice how the built in users has a filter filter by staffs that is super Beezer status active etc.

00:54.360 --> 00:57.000
so I can filter based off these different fields.

00:57.030 --> 01:00.440
I'm going to show you how to add in those kind of filters for your own models.

01:00.450 --> 01:03.670
On the admin page so to do that it's actually really simple.

01:03.870 --> 01:09.690
All you need to do is in this class that we created and you can do this for any model that you may just

01:09.690 --> 01:12.490
create another class such as customer admin.

01:12.630 --> 01:19.920
The attribute you need to add in is called Whoops list underscore filter and then you just added the

01:19.920 --> 01:24.570
list of things you want to filter by so different attributes of your model that you can filter by.

01:24.570 --> 01:30.030
So for movies what might make sense is filtering by for instance a release year or filtering by the

01:30.030 --> 01:30.500
genre.

01:30.510 --> 01:32.180
Or maybe even the length etc..

01:32.390 --> 01:35.500
Well probably does not make sense of filter by is the title.

01:35.700 --> 01:41.010
So I get to add all of these as filters that you can get an idea of how this actually works and why

01:41.010 --> 01:43.960
some of these choices are probably not good choices for filters.

01:43.980 --> 01:47.910
So I bring back my movies over here and I'm going to refresh.

01:47.980 --> 01:51.030
Now I can see over here on the right hand side let me kind of expand this.

01:51.030 --> 01:54.490
You can see it on the right hand side over here.

01:54.570 --> 01:55.500
We zoom in a bit.

01:55.560 --> 02:00.780
I can see by filter so filtering by really cear that may make sense because you know there's different

02:00.870 --> 02:05.850
or multiple movies per release year by length that could also make sense depending if things are standard

02:05.850 --> 02:07.310
length or not by title.

02:07.320 --> 02:12.750
Doesn't really make sense because titles probably a unique ID in this model so you don't want just kind

02:12.750 --> 02:14.720
of hundreds of titles here.

02:14.760 --> 02:20.670
So usually I want to filter by some sort of categorical attribute of your model where many movies or

02:20.670 --> 02:23.190
many objects are going to fit to that category.

02:24.250 --> 02:29.370
OK so that's how you can easily add in a filter and that's really all there is to it.

02:29.370 --> 02:32.710
As a quick review it's just an attribute of lists underscore filter.

02:32.800 --> 02:35.440
And then the actual attributes you want to filter by.

02:35.740 --> 02:37.910
OK thanks everyone and I'll say at the next lecture.
