00:05.690 --> 00:06.690
Welcome back everyone.

00:06.720 --> 00:11.610
And this lecture will show you how to create edits from the list you as I mentioned.

00:11.610 --> 00:14.870
You can also add the ability to edit attribute values from the list view.

00:14.880 --> 00:19.450
Instead of having to click into that detail view and again this is an easy attribute addition.

00:19.530 --> 00:22.370
Let's quickly show you how to hop over to the editor.

00:22.830 --> 00:29.940
OK so here I am an admin that pi the attribute need to add to this is called List underscore editable

00:30.330 --> 00:35.520
equals and then you just add in the list of the attributes or fields that you want to be able to edit

00:35.550 --> 00:36.740
from that list view.

00:36.870 --> 00:40.610
Now keep in mind those attributes are fields that you can edit.

00:40.650 --> 00:41.880
Also have to be displayed.

00:41.910 --> 00:43.530
Otherwise it won't make sense.

00:43.530 --> 00:46.170
You need to display something so you can edit it.

00:46.350 --> 00:50.360
So I'm going to go ahead and say let's edit the link.

00:51.110 --> 00:59.110
And then I will save this and then bring back my actual browser so bringing in my browser and this is

00:59.110 --> 00:59.950
what it looks like right now.

00:59.950 --> 01:05.810
Let me refresh this and you'll notice now in my list view I can edit the changes so maybe I can make

01:05.810 --> 01:11.070
this 100 minutes here and then save that and can see the changes and you can even see the filter affected

01:11.150 --> 01:12.280
those changes as well.

01:12.500 --> 01:17.330
So this makes it really easy to do both changes or bulk additions from the list view instead of having

01:17.330 --> 01:21.260
to click in to the actual detail view based off some sort of field.

01:21.260 --> 01:23.870
So again this hopefully makes your life a lot easier.

01:23.930 --> 01:28.760
Now as a quick note you should be cautious with this approach because if you intend the multiple people

01:28.760 --> 01:34.390
to have access to the admin page and have access to this list view you may cause problems.

01:34.400 --> 01:38.320
If they're trying to edit the same attribute or same field at the same time.

01:38.330 --> 01:44.180
Basically whoever clicked Save last ends up having the final say so keep that in mind that you kind

01:44.180 --> 01:45.400
of play around with this again.

01:45.500 --> 01:50.600
The attribute is if we can come back here is just list underscore editable and you have to remember

01:50.690 --> 01:52.800
that needs to be under display as well.

01:52.940 --> 01:55.010
OK thanks everyone and I'll see at the next lecture.
