00:05.420 --> 00:08.180
Hello everyone and welcome to this advanced topic section.

00:08.180 --> 00:14.930
Well we're going to be discussing customizing the jingo adamant interface now often the default admin

00:14.940 --> 00:20.820
page is great and it's all we need for our projects but sometimes we may also want to expand with the

00:20.820 --> 00:25.950
Admin Page can do and we also have a lot of tools and Django to customize it to our own needs and we're

00:25.950 --> 00:28.240
going to now learn how to customize it.

00:28.290 --> 00:31.920
Adam page as well as features of the atom in page.

00:32.060 --> 00:33.740
So we're going to learn how to do the following.

00:33.740 --> 00:37.070
We'll discuss a quick review of the atom in page how it's used.

00:37.130 --> 00:42.050
Then we'll change the out in page template so you can actually overwrite templates on the Admin Page

00:42.380 --> 00:46.820
and that will show you things like changing the order of fields that show up and adding search and filters

00:46.820 --> 00:48.040
to the Admin site.

00:49.150 --> 00:53.440
We're going to start by quickly creating a new project an application you won't really do anything on

00:53.440 --> 00:57.110
the front end since we really only are going to focus on the Adamant backend.

00:57.280 --> 01:01.690
So essentially it's just going to be an empty front and we have two models connected and registered

01:01.930 --> 01:02.950
to the admin.

01:02.950 --> 01:05.170
Let's shift to our editor and get started.

01:05.210 --> 01:05.470
OK.

01:05.470 --> 01:10.340
Here I am at the Adam text editor and one I'm going to do is just create a new project.

01:10.450 --> 01:14.410
I've gone ahead and created a new folder on my desktop called test to do this and really it doesn't

01:14.410 --> 01:16.780
matter too much for the size to do this.

01:16.780 --> 01:21.160
And we're going to call this my underscore video rental.

01:21.610 --> 01:24.820
We're going to kind of make it as if it's a rental video store web site.

01:24.820 --> 01:31.840
So go ahead and create that project and then I'm going to see the into my video rental here and then

01:31.840 --> 01:38.290
offer this I'll say jingo admen star app and we'll just call this app videos.

01:38.340 --> 01:43.860
And this is where we're going to have a model PI file and an admin file that we can later kind of play

01:43.860 --> 01:44.760
around with.

01:44.760 --> 01:47.110
So to expand this make sure that's all worked out.

01:48.070 --> 01:51.500
So you see my video rental I see videos I see models.

01:51.910 --> 01:58.310
So what I'm going to do is in my settings start by going to make sure I register this video here somewhere

01:58.360 --> 02:01.610
scroll down and and there are installed apps.

02:01.720 --> 02:06.420
Just go ahead and add that app name that we just created called videos.

02:06.580 --> 02:07.350
Save that.

02:07.450 --> 02:10.060
Always make sure you save so you can have those changes.

02:10.210 --> 02:14.590
There we're going to come over here to models and we're going to quickly create two models.

02:14.590 --> 02:16.110
Nothing too major here.

02:16.150 --> 02:21.820
The models we're going to create essentially just going to mimic having a movie and having a customer.

02:21.960 --> 02:22.450
So we'll say.

02:22.450 --> 02:25.030
Class movie.

02:25.480 --> 02:36.000
And then we'll say models the model and then let's give it some fields will say tidal is models.

02:36.160 --> 02:38.120
And we'll have it be a character field.

02:38.460 --> 02:43.950
Let's go ahead and give it a max length of 256 characters.

02:45.420 --> 02:48.300
And then let's say the movie has a length of minutes.

02:49.970 --> 02:53.490
And this is since it's lengthened minutes we know it has to be a positive integer.

02:53.520 --> 02:55.610
So we'll have that be that type of field.

02:55.920 --> 02:57.810
And then there's also a release year.

02:58.380 --> 03:01.810
And technically that should also be a positive integer so we'll do that as well.

03:01.830 --> 03:06.930
Just keeping things simple the main ideas not working with the models is working at the admin page.

03:07.010 --> 03:11.470
We're essentially just creating these because we need something to play around with later on.

03:11.490 --> 03:18.510
So I'm also going to create another model here called customer model and we'll say in her models not

03:18.510 --> 03:24.360
model it let's say customers have a first name let's say models.

03:24.420 --> 03:30.350
And that's also a character field if max length equal to 256.

03:30.430 --> 03:32.410
You can always copy and paste this from the notes as well.

03:32.460 --> 03:34.010
You don't want to type this all out.

03:34.380 --> 03:36.650
Now let's say last name is models.

03:36.660 --> 03:43.770
Basically the same thing here has a max length of 256 and then finally let's say you have some sort

03:43.770 --> 03:46.220
of phone number or some sort of digital code.

03:46.230 --> 03:50.430
Doesn't matter too much but we'll have that would also be some positive interest field.

03:50.460 --> 03:51.200
OK.

03:51.340 --> 03:57.050
So command or control s to say that and then I'm going to make sure that I register these into the item

03:57.050 --> 03:58.020
and file.

03:58.050 --> 03:59.360
So we'll come over here.

03:59.980 --> 04:07.800
To adamant that pie in our videos let's these We're going to say from the import models and then I'll

04:07.820 --> 04:14.720
see adman that PSI thought register is register and I'm going to register my models that way I can see

04:14.720 --> 04:16.500
them in the actual admin page.

04:16.580 --> 04:17.790
So I'm also a customer.

04:17.810 --> 04:28.670
And then Adam and that site the register models movie then it goes into control as to save that.

04:29.040 --> 04:31.930
And let's go ahead and make sure we do our migrations.

04:32.130 --> 04:35.670
So over here them of the terminal I can zoom in a little bit for you guys.

04:35.820 --> 04:37.110
I'm going to do the following.

04:37.110 --> 04:45.350
We'll say make sure say Python managed up high and then say make migrations.

04:45.670 --> 04:51.340
And it went ahead and created model and movie or excuse me create a model customer created a model movie

04:51.790 --> 04:57.040
that we're going to say Python managed up high and I'm going to migrate any changes that we have under

04:57.040 --> 04:58.040
videos.

04:58.180 --> 05:00.100
It may say running migrations.

05:00.100 --> 05:01.240
There we go.

05:01.300 --> 05:06.400
And then I always like to say make migrations one more time to make sure there's nothing left so no

05:06.400 --> 05:08.340
changes that are perfect.

05:08.350 --> 05:12.610
And since we're actually going to be using the admin interface we need to actually create a super user.

05:12.700 --> 05:14.020
So let's make sure we do that as well.

05:14.020 --> 05:20.560
We'll see Python managed up high and this line is create super user which you've done before and if

05:20.560 --> 05:21.610
you get this error.

05:21.670 --> 05:23.480
No such table off the user.

05:23.490 --> 05:25.000
It's actually an easy fix.

05:26.830 --> 05:29.730
It just means that you need to run Python managed that PI migrate.

05:29.800 --> 05:35.030
So come over here back to the terminal and say Python managed up-I migrate.

05:35.170 --> 05:37.640
Hit enter and let it migrate everything.

05:37.690 --> 05:38.530
Now try it again.

05:38.540 --> 05:44.740
Python managed up-I create super user and you should see it ask for your username.

05:44.770 --> 05:46.220
I'll say Jose.

05:46.240 --> 05:48.180
Email address doesn't really matter we'll see.

05:48.270 --> 05:51.270
Blank gmail dot com password.

05:51.280 --> 05:56.480
I always use test password and type it in again.

05:56.520 --> 06:02.300
Your password is hidden for security so there is no super user created successfully.

06:02.310 --> 06:07.880
Let's make sure it all works out so we'll see say now Python managed up-I run server.

06:08.280 --> 06:14.170
Enter there and then let's copy and paste the URL and bring it into our browser which I need to bring

06:14.170 --> 06:14.840
over now.

06:17.140 --> 06:19.340
So bringing in my browser it says it worked.

06:19.350 --> 06:21.270
Congratulations your first single power to pay.

06:21.280 --> 06:22.510
That's exactly what we want.

06:22.690 --> 06:25.630
As I mentioned before really not going to be doing anything on this front end.

06:25.810 --> 06:32.140
So let's go ahead and say slash admin and come over to her admin page my username and password are already

06:32.140 --> 06:32.910
filled out for me.

06:32.920 --> 06:34.050
Jose and his password.

06:34.210 --> 06:35.910
You may have to fill it in the Pentagon.

06:35.950 --> 06:37.430
How many times you've done this before.

06:37.450 --> 06:38.380
Go ahead and log in.

06:38.440 --> 06:39.310
And here we go.

06:39.310 --> 06:40.840
Let me make this full screen.

06:40.990 --> 06:42.670
I could see my groups and my users.

06:42.670 --> 06:47.310
That's often dictation authorization which we've actually discussed before you click here and users

06:47.360 --> 06:49.700
can see Jose blank as email.

06:49.720 --> 06:54.880
I have staff status etc. and you'll notice that I have a filter option here and we're going to discuss

06:54.880 --> 06:59.270
later on how to create these sort of filters on our own models.

06:59.270 --> 07:03.160
Bullets go ahead and go back home and check out our models.

07:03.160 --> 07:04.770
See here I have customers.

07:05.050 --> 07:09.400
And then if we come back to videos I can see here I have movies etc..

07:09.640 --> 07:13.720
So let's go ahead and create some customers willing to add a new customer here.

07:13.750 --> 07:16.300
Let's just how the customer be me as well.

07:16.540 --> 07:17.740
And then some sort of phone number.

07:17.740 --> 07:19.040
It doesn't really matter.

07:19.180 --> 07:26.080
So we're going to save and add another and then we'll make a couple more kind of generic names random

07:26.080 --> 07:30.460
phone numbers doesn't really matter save and add another and last one.

07:30.460 --> 07:31.240
Say.

07:32.720 --> 07:35.480
Let's say it's also Smith because I'm not very creative here.

07:35.480 --> 07:37.530
And then we're going to say safe.

07:37.610 --> 07:39.390
OK so we have three customer objects.

07:39.390 --> 07:40.640
Those really good.

07:40.670 --> 07:42.420
We'll come back to videos.

07:42.540 --> 07:43.610
Well same movies.

07:44.560 --> 07:47.000
And then we'll add some movies here.

07:47.240 --> 07:53.480
So let's go ahead and add in some Muzi movies traffic park let's say it's 120 minutes.

07:53.500 --> 07:53.910
Really.

07:53.920 --> 07:55.130
You're right.

07:55.180 --> 07:56.900
1993 I'm guessing.

07:57.070 --> 08:02.740
Save another one will say Star Wars like this one let's say it's 90 minutes I don't know if that's true

08:02.740 --> 08:03.190
or not.

08:03.250 --> 08:04.860
And I'll say 1973.

08:04.870 --> 08:05.970
I also don't know if that's right.

08:06.770 --> 08:11.000
And final is still one more movie here let's say Indiana Jones

08:13.850 --> 08:15.700
let's say it was in 1984.

08:15.890 --> 08:16.700
That's actually the length.

08:16.700 --> 08:22.390
So let's also say it's once 134 minutes and 94 again Polish making that up.

08:22.790 --> 08:23.020
OK.

08:23.060 --> 08:25.600
So now we have three movie objects and we're ready to go.

08:25.850 --> 08:32.480
So let's go ahead and go back to our page where we had the models and make the string representation

08:32.510 --> 08:35.810
not just say movie object to have it actually say the name.

08:35.810 --> 08:43.460
So we're going to go back over here and under models that PI notice at my class movie in class customer.

08:43.460 --> 08:47.270
Let's go ahead and give it a string representation that we've done before.

08:47.300 --> 08:54.140
We'll go ahead and here will say the F underscore underscore as TR underscore underscore it takes and

08:54.140 --> 08:57.260
self and it's going to return.

08:57.330 --> 09:04.780
Self-taught title will have that be the model and then also down here for the customer.

09:04.880 --> 09:07.380
We're going to add a method here.

09:07.460 --> 09:09.980
This will be self.

09:10.230 --> 09:18.900
And then let's have it return which is how it returns self first name and then we're going to concatenate

09:18.900 --> 09:29.290
it with self-taught last name and basically just concatenating the string and then a little space there

09:29.380 --> 09:30.650
and then the last name.

09:30.670 --> 09:35.530
So now that we've done all that let's go ahead and make sure that we migrate any changes that may have

09:35.530 --> 09:36.490
occurred.

09:36.610 --> 09:38.620
Will say Python managed of Pi migrate.

09:38.770 --> 09:41.690
They'll say running migrations no migration is to apply.

09:41.920 --> 09:49.120
So let's make sure that all works well say Python managed up high run server enter our servers running

09:49.120 --> 09:49.600
again.

09:49.600 --> 09:55.290
Let me come back to the browser and bring it over and I'm going to come straight to the Adamant page.

09:55.660 --> 10:01.630
OK so is the admin page and if we took out customers now we see Cindy Smith Mike Smith Jose Portsea

10:02.050 --> 10:03.760
and have it come back to movies.

10:03.760 --> 10:06.430
We can see Indiana Jones star wars Rasik park.

10:06.430 --> 10:11.530
So now that we have these kind of string representations here the string method we can see that it's

10:11.530 --> 10:17.230
printing out that string as its name cyclic in Indiana Jones gets a tidal length and release year etc..

10:17.490 --> 10:22.360
OK so that's the very basics of the Django adamant interface and everything that basically already comes

10:22.360 --> 10:23.330
for free.

10:23.330 --> 10:25.870
Nodine by free is that no work was involved.

10:25.960 --> 10:31.540
Which is kind of crazy when you think about it because this is a lot of kind of power features and already

10:31.540 --> 10:34.980
stuff that you can edit without having to code anything out.

10:35.020 --> 10:37.820
All you have to do is basically read straight to the oddments site.

10:37.930 --> 10:40.940
But we're going to learn how to add even more stuff to this.

10:40.960 --> 10:43.340
So the first thing to learn is how you can edit this template.

10:43.420 --> 10:48.430
Maybe you want things like a different color or instead of singing saying jingle admen or jingle administration

10:48.430 --> 10:52.490
you wanted to say like Blockbuster's admin page or something like that.

10:52.540 --> 10:55.860
Not every user is going to know what jingle Adam means etc..

10:55.970 --> 10:59.690
So in the next lecture we're going to learn how to actually edit these templates.

10:59.890 --> 11:01.060
Thanks and I'll see Ilir.
