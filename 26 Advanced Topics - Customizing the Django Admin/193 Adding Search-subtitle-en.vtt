Welcome back everyone.

00:06.750 --> 00:11.850
In this lecture will show you how to add search on your and view pages.

00:11.950 --> 00:17.270
So we currently only have a few entries in our models just a few movie titles a few customers but with

00:17.350 --> 00:21.760
a more realistic project ends up having hundreds or even thousands of entries.

00:21.790 --> 00:25.400
It's going to be hard to just quickly scroll through and find what you're looking for.

00:25.570 --> 00:30.610
We can add a search in the Admin Page to quickly and easily find what entry we're looking for and Gengel

00:30.610 --> 00:32.380
actually makes this incredibly easy.

00:32.380 --> 00:35.880
It's essentially just one Ashmit you add into a class.

00:36.100 --> 00:38.820
So let's hop over to the editor and show you how to do that.

00:39.160 --> 00:43.780
OK I'm back here at the editor and on your abdomen up Paey file remember these classes recreated created

00:43.780 --> 00:47.020
or we could add in fields or the ordering of fields.

00:47.040 --> 00:54.010
We can also do is add in an attribute called Search underscore fields and you can set that equal to

00:54.040 --> 00:59.380
a list of fields you want to actually search in the search box that jingoes going to automatically create

00:59.380 --> 01:00.520
for us.

01:00.520 --> 01:04.140
So for instance for movies you probably just want to search the title.

01:04.300 --> 01:08.860
You can imagine that if there was a description of this movie you may want to search that as well.

01:08.860 --> 01:13.750
Now the more terms or field you add in here in the search field that means the longer it's going to

01:13.750 --> 01:14.800
take to search something.

01:14.800 --> 01:20.380
However it's relatively quick so it shouldn't be a big deal to add in more fields here.

01:20.380 --> 01:26.050
However we probably don't want to add fields like length unless you intend to search for length in the

01:26.050 --> 01:26.990
search box.

01:27.010 --> 01:29.510
So I'm going to save this so you can see what this actually looks like.

01:29.660 --> 01:33.030
Let me bring in my abdomen page.

01:33.310 --> 01:35.120
So here's my ADD admin page.

01:35.170 --> 01:38.590
And we added a search field to movies so we click on movies Lotusphere.

01:38.590 --> 01:43.660
Now we get this nice little search box and what I can do is I can begin typing something like Indiana

01:44.860 --> 01:50.600
and then hit search and it's going to return anything where Indiana happened to be in that title.

01:50.880 --> 01:51.410
OK.

01:51.670 --> 01:57.010
Now if I'd search something like 1 to 3 or let's say 120 and hit search right now 0 movies pop up because

01:57.010 --> 02:01.770
it's not searching at the length of movies it's only searching the title of movies.

02:01.780 --> 02:07.480
So let's edit that so we can see the effect and I hope that over here and then let's go ahead and say

02:07.540 --> 02:09.830
length is something we can search as well.

02:10.090 --> 02:11.460
Save this.

02:11.680 --> 02:13.960
I'm going to refresh this come back.

02:13.960 --> 02:15.780
The videos come back to movies.

02:16.000 --> 02:21.370
And now I'm going to search for let's say 120 hit search and I see Jurassic Park shows up because remember

02:21.580 --> 02:24.340
now I can search for the link for movies if I click on dress park.

02:24.400 --> 02:26.530
That was the link for that movie.

02:26.530 --> 02:27.060
OK.

02:27.130 --> 02:31.490
That's really it for adding search as he saw it's incredibly easy and incredibly powerful.

02:31.510 --> 02:36.130
All you need to do is inside one of these classes add in the search mute search underscore fields and

02:36.130 --> 02:39.790
then add in a list of fields you want to search or remember to register.

02:39.850 --> 02:41.540
Along with the model.

02:41.860 --> 02:44.140
OK thanks everyone and I'll see at the next lecture.
