00:05.670 --> 00:06.450
Hello everyone.

00:06.450 --> 00:09.840
Welcome to part 10 of the blog clone project.

00:09.870 --> 00:14.580
So now it's time to actually debug and get our project up and running by setting up the admin and doing

00:14.580 --> 00:15.300
the migration.

00:15.300 --> 00:19.740
So let's go ahead and finish off this project and make sure that everything's working correctly.

00:19.740 --> 00:25.590
I'm going to hop over to the editor now OK here and the editor and the first thing I want to make sure

00:25.590 --> 00:30.730
that set up is adamant that PI file under blog haven't actually done the registrations yet.

00:30.770 --> 00:41.530
So what I'm going to do is say from looks log the models import post and comment and once are those

00:41.530 --> 00:42.440
ready to go.

00:42.670 --> 00:49.800
I'm going to say Admin site that register in should actually be a lower case or so we will register

00:50.280 --> 00:58.590
post and then we're going to do the exact same thing Admin site register and I'm going to register comment.

00:58.640 --> 01:04.600
So save that and then I'm going to bring up my terminal in the terminal here when I'm going to do is

01:04.610 --> 01:12.110
CD into the blog project folder and then let me CD into the my site folder.

01:12.110 --> 01:17.870
And this is where I should be able to call Python a managed up up-I and I will call migrate and see

01:17.870 --> 01:19.200
if that works for us.

01:19.270 --> 01:20.540
Make sure no errors.

01:20.540 --> 01:22.400
This may take a while if you haven't done it yet.

01:22.570 --> 01:25.300
And then the other thing we're going to do after this is OK here we go.

01:25.350 --> 01:27.810
Bingo we have some bugs that we need to do.

01:27.830 --> 01:33.620
So it says right here in 9:28 class comments name model is not defined which means you probably forgot

01:33.890 --> 01:36.650
to import something in the actual models.

01:36.680 --> 01:41.010
So let's come here to models that apply and make sure that's all fixed.

01:41.040 --> 01:46.370
So we'll come over here to this maybe either in the forms or let's see Knutsen the models that my file

01:46.790 --> 01:53.340
comes models up pie's that says models not the fine meaning the should have been coming down here.

01:53.620 --> 01:55.060
Those plural.

01:55.220 --> 01:56.360
So I'm going to save that.

01:56.360 --> 02:01.070
And let's run this again in a kind of trying to show you realistically how you would actually go about

02:01.370 --> 02:03.030
doing these sort of debugging.

02:03.110 --> 02:05.880
OK so this next bug that I got was an import error.

02:05.900 --> 02:07.250
No module named blogs.

02:07.250 --> 02:11.620
So all I have to do is scroll up and try to find out where was I trying to call blogs when I should

02:11.620 --> 02:17.690
have just been calling blog Cingular and it looks like here in line 22 of my morals under my site.

02:17.690 --> 02:19.800
I was calling blog site Oreilles.

02:19.850 --> 02:20.570
Easy enough.

02:20.570 --> 02:22.310
I just come back to your URLs that pie.

02:22.370 --> 02:28.240
Come over here and see where I was actually calling blogs and actually the wrong Urals peafowl.

02:28.250 --> 02:29.640
This one is the one I want.

02:29.930 --> 02:35.550
Scroll down and it says blogs that URL that should be blog Seether save that.

02:35.570 --> 02:36.390
No problem.

02:36.390 --> 02:37.890
And now let's try to run this again.

02:38.060 --> 02:41.270
And we're basically going to keep doing this until we fix all these various bugs.

02:41.270 --> 02:44.960
Now if you don't actually want to spend the time to go through this sort of more realistic debugging

02:44.960 --> 02:50.600
process feel free to just copy and paste all the text files from the actual notes.

02:50.750 --> 02:54.440
But this is kind of trying to show you what realistically would happen if we went about the project

02:54.440 --> 02:55.120
this way.

02:55.340 --> 02:57.230
OK so we have some invalid syntax.

02:57.260 --> 03:02.840
I probably forgot to close this off so I'll say from blog import views and the views that py file and

03:02.840 --> 03:05.510
a hopla over to that the used up by.

03:05.690 --> 03:11.810
And it looks like it's having issues with my syntax here and it's because I forgot a comma so save that.

03:11.810 --> 03:13.270
No problem.

03:13.280 --> 03:19.600
And Loren Python managed up high and needs to say your oh no migration is to play perfect.

03:19.880 --> 03:21.770
So let's actually check this out.

03:21.800 --> 03:27.180
Say Python managed up high and I going say make migrations blog.

03:27.350 --> 03:32.270
Run that and it looks like it said create model comment create model post at field post comment.

03:32.270 --> 03:35.510
Perfect way to say Python managed up high.

03:35.510 --> 03:36.500
Migrate again.

03:37.540 --> 03:39.750
And it's going to apply those migrations to the blog.

03:39.820 --> 03:40.630
Perfect.

03:40.760 --> 03:50.670
And now what I'm going to also do is say Python creates a actually Python manage that PI create super

03:51.320 --> 03:54.440
I can spell this right super user.

03:54.650 --> 04:00.950
And then what I'm also going to do here is hit enter and we may have an issue.

04:01.040 --> 04:06.860
So it says hits it seems you set a fixed date as a default for this field may not be what you want.

04:06.860 --> 04:09.090
Now do you want to have the current blah blah.

04:09.230 --> 04:10.830
You can actually ignore these for now.

04:10.880 --> 04:13.800
It's not a big deal given the way we're doing things.

04:14.180 --> 04:17.440
So we're going to do is say user name is Jose.

04:17.600 --> 04:20.690
Email address can just do whatever Hello.

04:20.890 --> 04:26.350
Email the password all use test password password again.

04:26.430 --> 04:30.900
Say as password and then the super user was created successfully.

04:30.900 --> 04:36.710
So let's see if we can actually get this project run well say Python managed up-I run server

04:39.830 --> 04:43.900
and there it is so time to kind of cross our fingers and make sure we actually get.

04:43.950 --> 04:45.080
We're going to copy that.

04:45.230 --> 04:49.260
And let's bring in over the browser.

04:49.310 --> 04:53.330
OK so coming to the Yoro page we see this no reverse match.

04:53.420 --> 04:59.930
And if it looks empty like this where it says no queries set or arguments or missings or a package tried

05:00.290 --> 05:03.520
this is a really common error when you're working with your old templates.

05:03.530 --> 05:08.940
And if you see here it says error during template rendering which kind of gives you a hint that it has

05:08.940 --> 05:12.530
to do templates and it's also in the template and it's right here.

05:12.620 --> 05:19.490
If you kind of zoom in me do a couple pluses here it's under post lists that T.M. error at line 0.

05:19.630 --> 05:23.250
And you notice that the first line we're doing is we're extending from base each tim L..

05:23.420 --> 05:25.800
So that's where we can look for this actual error.

05:25.850 --> 05:29.560
And this is something you're going to see all the time the sort of no reverse match especially when

05:29.560 --> 05:34.120
you're starting out which is why I kind of really want to show you how you can debug this on your own.

05:34.160 --> 05:39.710
So we'll come back to the editor over here and what I'm going to do is here have post-literate h tim

05:39.710 --> 05:46.220
L I can double check to make sure my you URLs are OK and usually a common mistake is to kind of mess

05:46.220 --> 05:49.470
up these quotes right here or forget these quotes up here.

05:49.730 --> 05:53.690
And if you come back to base at CML these are all looking OK to me.

05:53.900 --> 06:00.530
What we can do it baseline each Tomales do control f and then look up u r l and then explore which ones

06:00.530 --> 06:02.660
seem to be having the errors.

06:02.660 --> 06:04.990
So we see here we have this nav bars.

06:05.000 --> 06:08.200
There's your L's in there and we kind of find the culprit right here.

06:08.210 --> 06:14.190
Your post list looks like we forgot to put or I forgot to put in the quotes.

06:14.420 --> 06:15.940
So I will save that.

06:16.110 --> 06:19.570
And now let's kind of start this guy back up again.

06:19.700 --> 06:22.590
Well actually we can just play compare and refresh this page see if it works.

06:23.960 --> 06:26.460
And there it is my blog about hub Linked-In.

06:26.510 --> 06:30.220
So so far so good we'll keep our fingers crossed make sure everything's working.

06:30.220 --> 06:32.420
Hit that button and bingo have another.

06:32.450 --> 06:36.050
It's a template syntax error and it's happening at a count logon.

06:36.050 --> 06:39.100
So thanks to Django I kind of already have an idea where it's happening.

06:39.110 --> 06:42.740
It's happening log in that age T.M. but even better it says invalid.

06:42.770 --> 06:47.350
BLOCK tag that's a keyword with form as P says expected.

06:47.360 --> 06:51.830
End the block and you might be thinking well that's where we never have to put an end block with a form

06:52.220 --> 06:54.810
and then it says Did you forget to register or load this tag.

06:54.830 --> 06:59.760
Well maybe I did but that's weird because I wouldn't have an end block form as P..

06:59.900 --> 07:02.810
And if you scroll down it actually highlights it for you.

07:02.810 --> 07:06.220
And this is where we can actually see the error we did here.

07:06.320 --> 07:10.000
We were using the wrong template tagging remember with format as P just injected.

07:10.000 --> 07:11.660
It's not an actual code.

07:11.660 --> 07:13.250
Here with the percent sign.

07:13.250 --> 07:19.670
So coming back to our logged in that age T.M. what actually should have done was have the sort of syntax

07:19.670 --> 07:24.080
these double brackets since I'm essentially just injecting that form in.

07:24.440 --> 07:25.400
So I'm going to save that.

07:25.430 --> 07:31.370
And now let's try this again I'll come back refreshed the home page and now it seems to be working if

07:31.370 --> 07:34.580
I hit the person my user name is Jose.

07:34.760 --> 07:39.840
And then let's input test password log in see if we get an error.

07:40.070 --> 07:40.410
OK.

07:40.430 --> 07:43.630
Looks like I'm zoomed in right now which is why you kind of get this weird behavior.

07:43.640 --> 07:46.430
But if you start zooming out you see it right a line.

07:46.610 --> 07:48.280
So let's check this all out see if it works.

07:48.290 --> 07:50.310
I'll hit a new post see if we can there.

07:50.360 --> 07:51.390
So far so good.

07:51.680 --> 07:58.860
Jose the title of my post test post and let's type in some text so I'll say something like and we can

07:58.860 --> 08:00.790
see that the color changing is working.

08:00.810 --> 08:04.380
So this is a test.

08:04.620 --> 08:09.150
And if I highlight it I can see that if I put in bold here it's actually working so let's save this.

08:09.150 --> 08:12.360
If we get an error OK looks like that's actually working.

08:12.360 --> 08:13.570
Nice.

08:13.590 --> 08:16.140
Let's try editing it first.

08:16.230 --> 08:17.520
So it says this is a test.

08:17.550 --> 08:23.790
I'm going to say add on at it and it actually wants to be bold so we'll say something like underline

08:23.790 --> 08:27.910
it without the build and then save that.

08:27.970 --> 08:34.060
OK so looks like we are not seeing the actual content of the posts so just this test post we'll have

08:34.060 --> 08:34.980
to check back on that.

08:34.980 --> 08:37.990
But let's see if we publish it if we actually end up seeing that content.

08:37.990 --> 08:41.430
So I hit publish and nothing's happening I'm not being redirected anywhere.

08:41.530 --> 08:44.230
Meaning if I come over to my blog I don't see anything.

08:44.230 --> 08:48.640
So something has an issue when we're actually dealing with editing and posts.

08:48.670 --> 08:51.760
So let's come back here to draps and bingo.

08:51.760 --> 08:52.620
We found the air.

08:52.660 --> 08:52.880
OK.

08:52.900 --> 08:57.260
So now we see we have this field error at drafts and it says it cannot resolve.

08:57.260 --> 08:59.240
Keyword created in the field.

08:59.410 --> 09:00.940
Choices are Author Author.

09:00.960 --> 09:03.100
The comments create date etc..

09:03.130 --> 09:05.200
So this is actually quite an obvious error.

09:05.200 --> 09:10.480
Hopefully you can see here that somewhere along the lines I started calling it created that instead

09:10.480 --> 09:11.920
of create dates.

09:12.070 --> 09:13.590
So we have two options here.

09:13.630 --> 09:20.130
Either I change the model to have it say create a date or I changed his keyword to say create date.

09:20.380 --> 09:22.210
It's up to you at this stage.

09:22.210 --> 09:23.580
Which way you should go.

09:24.070 --> 09:28.210
If you already have a bunch of stuff in your models you already create a bunch of blog posts then you

09:28.210 --> 09:33.670
should probably affect the keyword here instead of the actual choices here but where we're going to

09:33.670 --> 09:37.550
do is kind of explore how we could fix this since we're just starting out.

09:37.630 --> 09:41.760
So I'll hop back over to this and I'm going to come to models of Pi.

09:41.770 --> 09:47.730
It's kind of confirm here I have create dates and what it should have been is created date.

09:47.950 --> 09:53.950
So I could do that or the other thing I could have done is go back to the actual reference of created

09:53.950 --> 09:57.550
date so if I come over to draft's loops Let's expand this.

09:57.580 --> 10:03.490
So coming over to my post draft list somewhere along the lines here I said created dates instead of

10:03.490 --> 10:04.530
create date.

10:04.670 --> 10:10.090
So I would actually usually recommend that you've fixed this in the H.T. mail template rather than coming

10:10.090 --> 10:12.130
over here and affecting your model.

10:12.130 --> 10:17.050
But since we're just starting out I think it's better to kind of switch the model out nuts also because

10:17.110 --> 10:22.870
this matches the notes so I will save this into to control see here and migrate everything again since

10:22.870 --> 10:24.320
I affected the model.

10:24.700 --> 10:33.690
So say Python managed up-I migrate and it has no migrations to apply so annoying to say Python managed

10:33.750 --> 10:41.480
up-I make migrations and then call blog over and it said Alter field.

10:41.620 --> 10:44.290
So I added this and alter that so perfect.

10:44.290 --> 10:49.390
So then we can all see its affecting comments and if we come over to comments let's make sure that's

10:49.480 --> 10:50.270
worked well.

10:50.290 --> 10:54.110
So we see create date there and let's have that be also created.

10:54.160 --> 10:56.250
So we're kind of going to fix that as well.

10:56.260 --> 11:01.410
Created dates and I will save that and Altes actually run that same line again.

11:01.870 --> 11:04.060
OK so it's altered that in the comments as well.

11:04.070 --> 11:11.170
And I have created they are both them and I won't say Python managed up-I migrates and it's going to

11:11.170 --> 11:12.900
apply all those changes.

11:12.910 --> 11:19.560
Let's start off by actually saying Python managed up-I run server and see if that works for us.

11:20.470 --> 11:24.060
I'm going to refresh my drafts and test post.

11:24.110 --> 11:24.660
Perfect.

11:24.890 --> 11:25.840
So I come to my blog.

11:25.850 --> 11:27.710
I have nothing to my drafts.

11:27.710 --> 11:28.950
Looks like that's working.

11:28.950 --> 11:33.430
It test post and it looks like I still can't register what I'm actually adding here.

11:33.620 --> 11:36.940
So if I type some stuff here you can see that the colors are changing.

11:36.950 --> 11:42.950
I can highlight stuff take away the underline I can save it but it's not actually showing the text so

11:42.950 --> 11:46.750
somewhere along the line I'm not injecting that text.

11:46.790 --> 11:48.300
So let's see if it works have comments.

11:48.290 --> 11:54.860
If I say add comments let's put in a new author for this comment so will say visitor will type this

11:54.860 --> 11:55.490
text.

11:55.550 --> 11:58.620
This is a comment text.

11:58.670 --> 12:02.390
I'm going to post the comments and it looks like I can see the text there.

12:02.390 --> 12:07.190
So to prove this so that comets don't approve but I still can't see a test post.

12:07.220 --> 12:12.710
Even when I click publish I can see that nothing's really happening so come back to my blog draft's.

12:12.740 --> 12:16.100
Something's wrong with that publish button so let's go check it out back here.

12:16.100 --> 12:20.160
All right so coming back to the post detail page which is where I should be going to.

12:20.220 --> 12:22.880
Chicken her again to review this coming down.

12:22.880 --> 12:27.770
Once you clicked publish somewhere so here it is once they click publish it should be taking me to the

12:27.770 --> 12:30.700
post detail page so something's up here.

12:30.710 --> 12:35.960
Let's go to that post detail page and see if we notice anything kind of fishy so I'm going to get a

12:35.960 --> 12:37.970
little more room here.

12:37.970 --> 12:42.040
And you'll notice that I have this post content class and appear.

12:42.110 --> 12:45.260
I'm calling the title over here and post content.

12:45.260 --> 12:46.940
I'm accidentally calling the title again.

12:46.970 --> 12:51.680
This should have been actually calling the contents of that post which makes sense and the content of

12:51.680 --> 12:53.690
that post was the text.

12:53.690 --> 13:01.140
So let's type that in a text and save that and see if we can continue debugging this as I refresh.

13:01.370 --> 13:04.430
And now I see this is a test add on Edit etc..

13:04.490 --> 13:06.420
So looks like that actually worked.

13:06.650 --> 13:09.380
Let's see if hitting the publish button affects this.

13:09.380 --> 13:14.780
Still I suspect would not do anything so there's publish or not getting any sort of redirect published

13:14.780 --> 13:18.740
but we figured out why wasn't showing that actual text of the post.

13:18.770 --> 13:23.250
So let's figure out how we can connect this publish button to actually work going to come back here

13:24.310 --> 13:28.090
and then let's check out the actual draft page or the post detail page.

13:28.090 --> 13:34.020
Looks like or it's let's actually try to track down the source of that error when you hit that publish

13:34.020 --> 13:35.760
button nothing's really happening.

13:35.760 --> 13:40.980
So if we come back to the post detailed view I see here that the button I'm pressing is this one right

13:40.980 --> 13:41.280
here.

13:41.280 --> 13:43.150
Class has a button default.

13:43.320 --> 13:48.720
And then if you look at the graph it's taking us to post publish with the primary key equal to postop

13:48.720 --> 13:49.660
piquet.

13:49.680 --> 13:54.230
So let's go ahead and review that post publish you l and see if there's the issue there.

13:54.350 --> 13:59.620
So I'll come over here you are I'll stop by and lo and behold the very last one is the publish one.

13:59.640 --> 14:00.930
Well that's interesting.

14:00.930 --> 14:06.900
And it looks here that this is OK it's going to take you to post the primary key and then publish the

14:06.900 --> 14:08.610
view is post published.

14:08.610 --> 14:09.300
That makes sense.

14:09.300 --> 14:11.200
And the name matches those published.

14:11.490 --> 14:13.540
So that means the culprit might be at The View.

14:13.620 --> 14:18.280
Let's go with the views that PI file and explore that so it can be used up high.

14:18.720 --> 14:23.240
And then we'll scroll down until we actually get to that post published for you that function view.

14:23.610 --> 14:29.250
And then here it is it says loggin required Post publish ill get object or four or four and then it's

14:29.250 --> 14:31.410
going to call this method on that post object.

14:31.410 --> 14:34.950
The published method and it's going to redirect you back to the post detail.

14:34.990 --> 14:41.280
So so for that actually kind of makes sense so maybe the problem is not with the view of the model itself.

14:41.280 --> 14:46.590
And if you remember back when we first started this Gengel tried to warn us about a time zone problem

14:46.590 --> 14:49.530
and we're basically about to see why it was trying to warn us.

14:49.530 --> 14:54.990
So one thing here is that I'm calling the method but not executing it.

14:55.020 --> 14:58.390
So that's the main error we have is I was executing it.

14:58.410 --> 15:04.290
So we're going to save that and then I'm also going to you can see immediately fix that.

15:04.320 --> 15:07.300
But besides that I also want to make sure that the post is OK.

15:07.310 --> 15:11.760
I'm going to come back to models that pie and remember that Jinger was warning us about some sort of

15:11.760 --> 15:12.860
time zone issue.

15:13.050 --> 15:17.570
Well we can see here that I was supposed to be actually calling publish instead of just whoops over

15:17.580 --> 15:19.220
and use that by assigning it.

15:19.440 --> 15:22.770
So we're actually calling it to execute now which makes more sense.

15:22.860 --> 15:27.510
And going back to models up-I in other issue that Gengel was complaining about which is a little hard

15:27.510 --> 15:32.850
to explain if you haven't seen it often is the issue of the date time field the default being time zone.

15:32.890 --> 15:39.260
Now I was actually calling it to execute Q But what it really wants appear is just the function itself.

15:39.270 --> 15:42.410
So you don't execute it here inside of that date time field.

15:42.450 --> 15:46.690
So now I'm going to save that and I will also save my post detailed page.

15:46.770 --> 15:53.290
And let's try this again and then to refresh and then again to hit publish and Whoops looks like I need

15:53.290 --> 15:54.180
to log in again.

15:54.430 --> 16:01.660
So we'll say test password log in and now we can see that the publish is gone.

16:01.660 --> 16:06.060
So if I go back to my blog now I see a test post with one comment.

16:06.130 --> 16:07.080
Perfect.

16:07.090 --> 16:11.520
So let's try this all again and make sure that it's actually working or create a new post.

16:11.590 --> 16:14.180
It's going to be by me in full call.

16:14.180 --> 16:20.050
We called this last test post and we'll say hello world.

16:20.050 --> 16:25.210
My site is functional all hit save.

16:25.400 --> 16:26.430
Looks like it says hello world.

16:26.430 --> 16:27.500
My say is functional.

16:27.530 --> 16:29.430
If I hit draft's I should see it there.

16:29.450 --> 16:31.130
Last test post perfect.

16:31.160 --> 16:33.470
And then if I add a comment I should be able to do that.

16:33.500 --> 16:40.820
You already tested this out but let's try this again some visitor blah blah blah whatever.

16:40.870 --> 16:47.340
Post comments here I can see it can either be removed or approved and I'm going to try to publish this

16:48.660 --> 16:53.040
and looks like the publisher is gone and he gets publication they come to my blog and I see less test

16:53.040 --> 16:53.570
posts.

16:53.730 --> 16:57.630
Let's make sure I can actually remove and delete posts so that there wasn't any issues to delete views

16:57.990 --> 17:00.940
going to delete this post right here by pressing x.

17:01.050 --> 17:01.590
Perfect.

17:01.590 --> 17:04.620
Are you sure you want to confirm that you want to delete this.

17:04.620 --> 17:08.670
Like I mentioned maybe having loader and everything isn't a good idea since this is constantly changing

17:08.670 --> 17:11.970
colors but will go ahead and confirm and looks like it deleted it.

17:12.030 --> 17:16.500
So my blog and I can also cook on about make sure it takes into that temple of view about this company.

17:16.500 --> 17:20.250
Thanks for checking it out and let's make sure I can log out and still see everything.

17:20.310 --> 17:26.280
So if I log out it my blog hit test post everything's functional and it looks like we were able to successfully

17:26.520 --> 17:29.420
get rid of all the errors and troubleshoot this thing.

17:29.610 --> 17:33.650
That was more or less a realistic experience of what it would be like debugging the stuff.

17:33.660 --> 17:38.150
I think the hardest thing as far as this particular debugging call was this one right here.

17:38.190 --> 17:43.110
When we come to models and fix this time zone that now in fact we haven't even agreed to that change

17:43.110 --> 17:44.690
it so hasn't taken place.

17:44.700 --> 17:48.690
But that's the only one where you really have to have experience to understand that you want it to just

17:48.790 --> 17:51.960
passen the function itself instead of calling a function.

17:52.000 --> 17:57.570
So to fix that again you'd have to do is come over here and then call Python managed up-I migrate again.

17:57.570 --> 18:02.720
So we'll do that before we actually host the Web site on some sort of server.

18:03.180 --> 18:04.490
Ok thanks everyone.

18:04.500 --> 18:08.490
Hope you enjoyed the basics of the project and hope this gave you some ideas of how you can create your

18:08.490 --> 18:09.290
own blog.

18:09.600 --> 18:11.130
Thanks and I'll see at the next lecture.
