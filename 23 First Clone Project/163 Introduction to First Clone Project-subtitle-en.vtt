Hello everyone and welcome to the blog clone project.

00:04.430 --> 00:06.260
So this is your first clone project.

00:06.260 --> 00:10.850
I want to congratulate you on making it this far into the course and this project will be creating a

00:10.850 --> 00:15.620
blog and not just a personal blog but you can think of it more as a company blog since ill be able to

00:15.620 --> 00:17.140
have multiple users.

00:17.150 --> 00:21.520
This is actually a great first step to building a larger more robust social network application.

00:21.650 --> 00:26.720
As a lot of the knowledge here is going to be directly transferred to our social network clone projects

00:28.020 --> 00:32.220
and this project will include topics on almost everything we've covered so far so take it on slowly

00:32.220 --> 00:33.240
and carefully.

00:33.390 --> 00:37.990
And I've made sure to add in elements from pretty much every section of the course.

00:38.130 --> 00:43.340
So if you skip to Section make sure you review it before actually coming onto this clone project and

00:43.350 --> 00:47.480
I really recommend having the jingle documentation open so you can cross-reference anything new you

00:47.480 --> 00:49.810
see.

00:49.810 --> 00:52.300
This blog is going to be a multi-user blog as I mentioned.

00:52.330 --> 00:57.190
So it's kind of more like a company blog rather than just a simple personal blog interface and this

00:57.190 --> 01:01.010
multi-user behavior is going to be easily extendable to feature projects.

01:02.260 --> 01:06.960
So we're also going to be adding in some fun javascript and CSSA features to give the site a more complete

01:06.990 --> 01:07.670
feel.

01:07.950 --> 01:11.280
So let's take a look at what the completed Web site actually looks like.

01:12.930 --> 01:13.290
All right.

01:13.290 --> 01:14.760
This is what the Web site looks like.

01:14.760 --> 01:19.770
Running locally and you can see here that I have some kind of fun see assess where the colors of the

01:19.770 --> 01:21.580
blog posts are slowly changing.

01:21.630 --> 01:25.960
And even if I highlight everything my highlighted color will also slowly change.

01:25.980 --> 01:30.550
Obviously that's completely optional but that's going to be a little fun CSSA element we add to that.

01:30.600 --> 01:34.840
And that's actually Pearcey SS That's not any javascript which is interesting.

01:35.130 --> 01:39.140
So are we gonna be able to do is click here on the sort of profile tab.

01:39.450 --> 01:41.480
And that's going to show you how to use a glyph icon.

01:41.880 --> 01:45.900
And then here will say Please log in must be a super user so we can log in.

01:45.900 --> 01:50.580
I can see stuff is changing colors and then once you've done that I'm a little zoomed in here so you

01:50.580 --> 01:56.400
can see it but at 100 percent zoom in we can see we can create a new post and then we create a new post

01:56.410 --> 02:03.660
select an author title will be my great post and then you can see here you can begin to type text so

02:03.660 --> 02:06.420
I'll say something like Hello world.

02:06.600 --> 02:12.540
And if you've ever used a Web site called Medium dot com which is kind of a blogging site you'll know

02:12.540 --> 02:17.760
that if you highlight something it gives you options on stating whether something's bold whether it's

02:18.090 --> 02:23.580
italics underline or two or three and we're going to actually add in that functionality whether you

02:23.580 --> 02:30.270
want to link in here to this could take you to something like Google dot com and now it's a link etc..

02:30.330 --> 02:31.870
So that's all now in Javascript.

02:31.890 --> 02:33.220
And we're going to learn how to add that in.

02:33.240 --> 02:38.390
So then I can save this I have migrate posts and then I can also add comments to it.

02:38.550 --> 02:40.440
But note that it's right now a draft.

02:40.440 --> 02:47.390
So if I check my drafts I have draft and I publish another messed up draft and have migrate posts.

02:47.430 --> 02:51.020
Click on that and then I can say publish this to the entire world.

02:51.190 --> 02:56.510
And now if I look at my tech blog the home page I can see migrate post has been published.

02:56.590 --> 03:02.440
So then I'll migrate posts or any post really we can edit the post so I can come over here and Edsels

03:02.590 --> 03:05.490
say you at it.

03:06.650 --> 03:15.450
Save that bloops the Riego and hear you say hello world and you at it and I can also add comments to

03:15.450 --> 03:22.170
it so I can say some visitor type the text in a.

03:22.360 --> 03:30.260
That is a post and then they also get access to data things like Boulder heading to maybe don't want

03:30.260 --> 03:32.130
that but you never know.

03:32.270 --> 03:37.400
And then we'll post that comment and it says hey that is a post posted by some visitor and as a user

03:37.430 --> 03:43.490
I get to approve or remove comments so I approve that comment check it and then it takes me back to

03:43.490 --> 03:44.630
my post.

03:44.790 --> 03:50.720
If I look at my tech blog come back to my great post I can see here has one comment and there we go.

03:50.720 --> 03:54.220
And then you can also use this to link to get hub linked in.

03:54.230 --> 03:57.580
There there's an about page maybe it is about your company or about me.

03:57.630 --> 03:58.380
Cetera.

03:58.640 --> 03:59.670
So lots of cool stuff here.

03:59.670 --> 04:03.950
I'm going to learn a lot and believe it not a lot of this functionality is actually not that hard to

04:03.950 --> 04:06.500
implement given what you learned already.

04:06.510 --> 04:08.480
And then finally the last thing you can do is delete posts.

04:08.480 --> 04:14.100
You can click on this little X or if she wanted to migrate posts click confirm and athletes to post.

04:14.120 --> 04:18.120
All right so let's hop over quickly to the slides and finish this all up.

04:18.340 --> 04:21.510
All right just a few last notes before we get started.

04:21.530 --> 04:26.510
It's also really common for real jingle projects to make use of other open source third party libraries

04:26.660 --> 04:27.980
and we're going to be using quite a few.

04:28.010 --> 04:30.980
So make sure you follow along when we install them.

04:30.980 --> 04:35.810
If you're kind of going with the code and you ever get an error called No module names some sort of

04:35.810 --> 04:38.100
module it's probably because you forgot to install it.

04:38.180 --> 04:42.400
So all you have to do is go the command line say Pipp install that particular module name instead of

04:42.410 --> 04:43.390
a virtual environment.

04:44.720 --> 04:48.920
And we're also going to be exploring different ways of organizing or jingle projects and we've previously

04:48.920 --> 04:51.990
discussed this organization method in the class based views section.

04:52.010 --> 04:55.380
Definitely going to be implementing a lot of ideas from that previous section.

04:55.400 --> 04:58.790
So make sure to review it before heading on to this project.

04:59.500 --> 05:04.860
In a few final important notes no amount of clone projects can show you how to use and do everything.

05:05.010 --> 05:08.880
So you're going to need to feel comfortable venturing out on your own and read the documentation when

05:08.880 --> 05:11.560
it comes to your own personal projects.

05:11.750 --> 05:16.160
And if you're interested in learning a specific plug in library or API you're probably going to need

05:16.160 --> 05:17.800
to reference outside of materials.

05:17.840 --> 05:24.420
If you're not covered in these projects and one last final know you should be able to have a full understanding

05:24.420 --> 05:29.910
of how we're building up the clone project shown here but not necessarily memorizing every certain class

05:29.910 --> 05:31.800
call or function name etc..

05:31.820 --> 05:35.670
You should have an understanding but don't feel obligated that you had to have everything memorized

05:35.880 --> 05:38.100
by this point in the course.

05:38.130 --> 05:39.790
All right let's get started.

05:40.020 --> 05:41.200
I'll see you at the next lecture.
