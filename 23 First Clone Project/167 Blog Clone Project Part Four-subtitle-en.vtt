00:05.270 --> 00:09.690
Welcome back everybody to part for the blog Klon project.

00:09.690 --> 00:14.670
So now it's time to actually get to the meat of the project which is creating views and templates and

00:14.670 --> 00:16.720
connecting them to your else.

00:16.740 --> 00:21.960
We'll start off with the class based views handling the actual blog posts and the basic structure that

00:21.960 --> 00:27.000
we're going to follow here is we'll try to create a view see how to set it up and then we'll create

00:27.010 --> 00:28.900
the template that matches with that view.

00:29.040 --> 00:33.860
A lot of class based views have some sort of default template name so we'll create that template we

00:33.870 --> 00:36.170
will actually fill out those H.A. files.

00:36.240 --> 00:38.100
We'll do that in a future lecture.

00:38.100 --> 00:38.410
OK.

00:38.430 --> 00:39.140
Let's get started.

00:39.140 --> 00:40.930
Hop over to the editor.

00:40.980 --> 00:47.480
OK so the first step here is to actually go to views that pie underneath our blog folder and other need

00:47.490 --> 00:51.750
templates I also have a blog folder here which is where I will be adding those ASTM l files.

00:51.750 --> 00:56.760
So let's start off by actually creating the baseline each team file that will be inheriting or extending

00:56.760 --> 00:57.680
from.

00:57.690 --> 01:02.750
So I will create a new file under blog and call it base h TNL.

01:03.060 --> 01:04.040
So there it is.

01:04.080 --> 01:08.820
And I'll just type in H-2 him here later on we'll work a lot more with his team files.

01:09.000 --> 01:14.050
But coming back to views that PI Let's start off with that about page since that's one of the simplest

01:14.050 --> 01:15.120
ones we have to do.

01:15.880 --> 01:26.940
So I will say from jingo views the generic import and I'm going to import with princes since I'm going

01:26.940 --> 01:27.980
to do multiple imports.

01:27.990 --> 01:30.870
I can use princes have them across multiple lines.

01:31.030 --> 01:35.970
And the first one that I want is this template you so will say.

01:36.330 --> 01:46.910
Class and we'll call this the about you and this will be a template view and all we do here is say the

01:46.910 --> 01:48.710
template underscore a name.

01:48.950 --> 01:54.270
And we're going to connect that to about the H Tim L and that's really all we have to do.

01:54.320 --> 02:01.040
And then we're going to come here to blog create a new file call it about each T.M. and then we can

02:01.040 --> 02:10.660
say well we're here or something like extends and then in quotes something like blog slash based Timo

02:11.240 --> 02:16.100
and then we can add a lot more content in here like the body block etc. But once we have that the other

02:16.100 --> 02:19.220
thing I want to do is add this to our list of your else.

02:19.460 --> 02:27.600
So coming back to your stop pie notice I'm under the blog you're up high which is currently empty.

02:27.620 --> 02:34.550
So let's set up a way to connect our sites Yarl's that pie to our actual blog you are that pie.

02:34.580 --> 02:39.030
So I'll come first to the Eurostar pie of our entire site.

02:39.050 --> 02:43.100
So this one already has a configuration that will scroll all the way down.

02:43.370 --> 02:51.080
And then when I'm going to do here is say also import include since I'll be using that and then I need

02:51.080 --> 02:58.130
to import some views so I will say actually we'll skip that for now.

02:58.140 --> 03:03.670
I we'll say your el and basically I'm just going to say anything.

03:03.680 --> 03:14.470
That's not the admin page go to blogs thought else and we can pass this as a string and then that's

03:14.470 --> 03:21.390
going to do is going to look for the blocks application and then find that Urals that PI file.

03:21.440 --> 03:23.220
So we'll save that for now.

03:23.300 --> 03:27.530
And that means we can come back to this Yarl's that PI file and start editing it.

03:27.530 --> 03:32.470
We're not quite done with the project's URLs that PI file but for now we'll just leave it like that.

03:32.510 --> 03:36.770
We have to add in all that registration stuff but we'll talk about that once we actually get to that

03:38.030 --> 03:41.170
for the PI file of the blog application.

03:41.190 --> 03:50.150
I'm going say from Jingo the Siona for configuration thought you Elle's import Yoro.

03:50.370 --> 03:55.330
And then I'll say from blog import views.

03:55.450 --> 04:00.010
And as always you could have also said from datt import views and then we're going to have a your all

04:00.010 --> 04:05.770
patterns list and this will eventually grow to be a super large list and we just have this all basically

04:05.770 --> 04:07.730
feeding into the single application.

04:07.930 --> 04:16.430
But let's start off by saying your L and we'll have the about page B slash about.

04:16.540 --> 04:24.130
So let's do this with regular expressions and we'll say about slash dollar sign.

04:24.320 --> 04:26.690
And this is going to be views.

04:26.840 --> 04:28.820
And then the about you we just created.

04:28.840 --> 04:37.580
Remember we have to say as of you know we'll give it the name about Khama save.

04:37.590 --> 04:37.880
All right.

04:37.900 --> 04:40.880
So our first view is basically done now.

04:40.930 --> 04:44.800
So let's come back to use that pie and start the next one.

04:44.890 --> 04:48.860
And basically we're going to be doing over and over again there's going to be a ton of your all's views.

04:49.030 --> 04:51.770
And as I mentioned that's kind of the meat of the entire project.

04:51.820 --> 04:59.530
So the actual home page is going to be the list of all the posts so I'll say class a post list view.

04:59.900 --> 05:05.790
And that's going to inherit from a list view so let's have that in on our import statement comma list

05:05.840 --> 05:09.670
view and then I'm going to start a new line here.

05:11.890 --> 05:19.560
Later on we'll add some more imports so I'll have a list of you that I'm inheriting from and then I

05:19.560 --> 05:21.560
need to connect that to a model.

05:21.840 --> 05:26.480
So I'm going to connect this to the post model but in order to do that I should actually import it.

05:26.610 --> 05:33.920
So coming back up here we'll say from blog models import and let's import both models are created.

05:33.920 --> 05:41.770
We created a post model and a comment model and then the other thing I want to do here is actually define

05:41.770 --> 05:43.850
how I want to grab this list.

05:43.930 --> 05:49.610
So when we get a little more room here Heidi that terminal and basically what I can do is I can create

05:49.640 --> 05:55.600
a method called Get underscore query set self.

05:56.110 --> 06:01.270
And this allows me to use jingoes or M when dealing with just generic views.

06:01.260 --> 06:04.000
That way I can add a little more of a custom touch to it.

06:04.120 --> 06:08.880
So we kind of do this a lot when we were in a function based views but we can actually do this as well

06:08.920 --> 06:10.260
with class based views.

06:10.330 --> 06:15.550
By the finding particular get methods and we'll get a lot more practice with this in future projects.

06:15.550 --> 06:23.350
But basically what I say is the actual queries I want is going to be post all the objects and I want

06:23.350 --> 06:34.870
to filter them by the published underscore dates and then I'm also going to add an underscore underscore

06:35.200 --> 06:40.830
T and I will set that equal to time zone.

06:40.860 --> 06:50.070
Now and then I'm going to also say dots order by and let me collapse this directory tree to get some

06:50.070 --> 07:00.900
more room here and then I'm going to say as a string dash published underscore dates.

07:01.140 --> 07:03.350
And that's my whole query set.

07:03.360 --> 07:05.880
All right so what does this all actually mean.

07:05.880 --> 07:13.940
Well with the get queries set I'm basically almost doing a query like a sequel query on my model.

07:14.040 --> 07:19.620
So this is essentially kind of pie funnies version of writing a sequel query.

07:19.620 --> 07:28.250
So what I'm saying is grab the post model all the objects there and filter out based on these conditions.

07:28.300 --> 07:33.820
So then we have grabbed the published they and then with the field queries you can do this really interesting

07:33.820 --> 07:39.280
thing where you say underscore underscore and then the actual field.

07:39.280 --> 07:43.260
So in this case it's going to be less than or equal to.

07:43.390 --> 07:48.070
And I'm going to hop over to documentation link a little bit to kind of explain this part a little more

07:48.080 --> 07:50.590
because out of all this is probably the strangest thing.

07:50.620 --> 07:53.850
Underscore underscore LTE which we've never seen before.

07:53.870 --> 08:01.540
We haven't really died this deep into the OR AM of jingo but basically this is asking is OK grabbed

08:01.570 --> 08:07.930
the published dates that are Lessner equal to the current time and then order them by published day.

08:07.960 --> 08:14.720
Except with this dash we can clarify whether we want ascending or descending because if we were not

08:14.720 --> 08:20.890
to order them by Dasch published they would be happening is we would see the oldest blog post first.

08:21.080 --> 08:25.660
So here with this dash I can order them in kind of a descending order.

08:25.700 --> 08:31.960
So the most recent blog post comes up front or at the top of this list view.

08:32.300 --> 08:38.270
So this is the get query set method and essentially allows you to use this or sort of a particular query

08:38.450 --> 08:43.970
on a list so you can only get items that you want in the list with some sort of filter and then you

08:43.970 --> 08:45.220
can also order them.

08:45.410 --> 08:50.810
So let me hop over to the documentation briefly to explain a little more about this kind of curious

08:50.810 --> 08:53.350
line underscore underscore LTE.

08:53.360 --> 08:59.450
All right so here I am at the documentation now with the documentation for 1.1 0 although if that by

08:59.450 --> 09:02.860
the time you're looking at this it's one point eleven This should be basically the same.

09:03.100 --> 09:10.360
And I'm on their slash topic slash slash queries and I can just do control Ephor command and look up.

09:10.370 --> 09:17.030
Underscore underscore LTE and you'll find a simple example but this all falls under field lookups where

09:17.030 --> 09:22.750
it's essentially how you can specify some sort of sequel query using the query set methods.

09:22.760 --> 09:28.610
And there's three main Chrisette set methods filter exclude and get and the basic lookups look like

09:28.610 --> 09:29.110
this.

09:29.120 --> 09:34.760
The actual field you want the fields of our model member those are the attributes and then underscore

09:34.760 --> 09:38.380
underscore and then the lookup type equal to some sort of value.

09:38.480 --> 09:41.000
And again that's a double underscore.

09:41.000 --> 09:45.800
So for example in this kind of plays along with what we've done is we say entry so whatever that model

09:45.800 --> 09:50.480
was the object so grabble as objects and then filter them based on some condition.

09:50.480 --> 09:56.660
In this case they want where the publication date is less than or equal to this particular value.

09:56.720 --> 09:59.360
So roughly translates into the following sequel.

09:59.450 --> 10:01.370
If you're not familiar sequel don't worry about this too much.

10:01.390 --> 10:03.780
But if you are this is probably really helpful to you.

10:04.010 --> 10:09.770
So it says select everything from a blog entry or whatever entry we have here where the publication

10:09.770 --> 10:11.800
date is less than equal to this particular date.

10:11.810 --> 10:15.370
So almost exactly the same example that we're working with here.

10:15.440 --> 10:19.190
Now if you're curious more about how this is actually possible because this is definitely some more

10:19.190 --> 10:23.870
advanced Python as far as how the creators of Django kind of built this and with this underscore underscore

10:24.110 --> 10:26.030
they have a link here to keyword arguments.

10:26.040 --> 10:31.550
They can read more into but but you're probably more interested in is how to actually figure out what's

10:31.550 --> 10:36.500
possible here in this double underscore how you actually keep scrolling down.

10:36.560 --> 10:41.400
And then there's various examples that are available to you so you can say underscore underscore exact

10:41.450 --> 10:47.030
which translates into just an equal call and keep scrolling down you can say I exact which is going

10:47.030 --> 10:50.170
to be case insensitive matching you can say contains.

10:50.210 --> 10:55.670
And this essentially just he keeps rolling down a bunch of stuff that has to do with translating sequel

10:55.700 --> 10:57.670
code into Python.

10:57.770 --> 11:03.920
But the weird confusion about it is this more advanced Python mechanism where you have these double

11:03.920 --> 11:09.090
underscores separating the actual field versus the type of comparison you're doing.

11:09.110 --> 11:13.070
Now we're not going to be using these too often throughout this particular project but I do want you

11:13.070 --> 11:16.210
to be aware of them and later on in a few trial section.

11:16.220 --> 11:20.650
We'll talk more about the OR em that Shingo has but I just want you to be aware.

11:20.660 --> 11:25.340
Again you can always check the documentation page here if you want more in-depth information on this

11:25.400 --> 11:28.770
but that's a little background to where we got all those commands from.

11:29.210 --> 11:29.670
OK.

11:29.780 --> 11:31.340
So that's the post list view.

11:31.490 --> 11:37.250
Let's minimize this and go add this view to actual Uriel's that PI file.

11:37.280 --> 11:41.570
So I'm going to come over to your Allsopp high of my blog.

11:41.570 --> 11:42.670
So there it is.

11:42.680 --> 11:44.290
And let's actually listen.

11:44.720 --> 11:48.290
So I'll say Khama call your all again.

11:48.680 --> 11:54.470
And then what I'm going to do here is since this is actually going to be the home page let's delete

11:54.470 --> 11:56.370
this and let's make this the top one.

11:56.390 --> 11:59.870
So usually you always see the homepages First you are a pattern.

12:00.140 --> 12:01.500
So let's do that here.

12:02.950 --> 12:14.200
So I'll say our care and then dollar sign and this is going to accept the use dot post list view to

12:14.590 --> 12:22.040
underscore view and then I'm going to set the name equal to post underscore list which is kind of the

12:22.040 --> 12:25.900
default name it expects here and that's it.

12:25.920 --> 12:32.730
So again I'm setting the home page to all my current blog posts that are published and that's it for

12:33.390 --> 12:35.230
that particular post list view.

12:35.310 --> 12:37.230
So let's continue moving along.

12:37.230 --> 12:40.690
And you can always reference the code to make sure it matches exactly.

12:40.690 --> 12:42.300
So if you ever get stuck on something.

12:42.300 --> 12:48.830
Make sure you're checking out the code notes next year we're going to make is another class based view

12:49.280 --> 12:51.890
So let's say you have those lists of posts at click on one.

12:51.950 --> 12:53.800
It takes me to an actual blog post.

12:53.900 --> 12:56.000
That means it's a detailed view.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.770
So this one's a lot simpler.

12:57.770 --> 13:03.960
All I have to do is say post detail view and then what I'm going to do is appear.

13:04.030 --> 13:06.610
Let's import detail.

13:07.640 --> 13:14.840
Say that and here I'm going to say detail view and underneath the detail view.

13:14.850 --> 13:19.820
All I have to do is say model is equal to post and that's it.

13:19.890 --> 13:22.020
That's a detail view as we've seen before.

13:22.260 --> 13:27.680
Let's go at it in I'll come over to my Urals up-I blog.

13:27.720 --> 13:30.330
And then a lot of this is taken care of for me.

13:30.570 --> 13:40.020
So we'll say your el and then here we're going to do is for a post the tilt view I'll say that's going

13:40.020 --> 13:45.480
to be under post and then I'm going to add some regular expressions here which is going to basically

13:45.480 --> 13:51.110
be taking the primary key and we've seen this a little bit before but let's go ahead and show it again.

13:51.330 --> 13:54.870
It's going to be question mark p..

13:55.020 --> 14:04.790
And then it's going to accept piquing like this backslash the plus and then outside of this dollar sign.

14:04.870 --> 14:08.500
And again I would never really expect anyone to know this off the top of my head and lost it working

14:08.560 --> 14:10.290
a lot with Django.

14:10.330 --> 14:14.410
This is more the kind of thing that you reference other examples with documentation for.

14:14.800 --> 14:16.480
But we've already seen how do a detail.

14:16.490 --> 14:21.420
So we've seen this or something very similar to this before but luckily a lot of this heavy lifting

14:21.610 --> 14:27.200
for us in our lives that say is post detailed view and call as View.

14:27.220 --> 14:32.040
And this will automatically take care of matching the primary key to whatever you clicked on.

14:32.560 --> 14:40.860
And then let's give this a name and we'll set the name equal to just post underscore detail.

14:40.870 --> 14:42.590
OK so that's a detail view of that post.

14:42.610 --> 14:49.560
Let's save that and we'll hop right back over to use that pi and move onto the next class based view.

14:49.650 --> 14:52.080
We're going to kind of get some more space here.

14:52.540 --> 15:00.130
And next thing I want to do is sort of create view so I'll say class and we'll say create post view

15:01.010 --> 15:04.860
and then we want to inherit from create view.

15:04.860 --> 15:06.970
But first thing you need to do is actually import it.

15:07.020 --> 15:13.390
So we'll come back up here and then we'll say create a view save that come down.

15:13.770 --> 15:19.400
And then what I want to do is connect my model to be able to post.

15:19.420 --> 15:20.860
And that's what we've seen before.

15:20.980 --> 15:24.320
But there's a couple of more things so we want to do here.

15:24.490 --> 15:31.450
And the main thing we want to do is I don't want anyone to be able to access this create post view earlier

15:31.480 --> 15:34.670
when we were talking about authentication authorization.

15:34.840 --> 15:40.630
We discussed using decorator's So remember we had that at symbol we have something like lock in required

15:41.080 --> 15:43.630
but that only really works for function based views.

15:43.630 --> 15:49.170
And now we want to know how do we actually work with that sort of log in required with a class based

15:49.180 --> 15:49.830
view.

15:49.930 --> 15:52.420
And that's where the term mixdowns come in.

15:52.420 --> 15:57.430
So you haven't seen any real Moxon's but they're really easy to use just like those decorators were

15:57.430 --> 15:58.320
easy to use.

15:58.390 --> 16:02.400
You just scroll at the top here and you're going to import them.

16:02.540 --> 16:11.450
So I won't say from jingo contrib you th mixdowns.

16:11.620 --> 16:13.040
I'm going to import.

16:13.340 --> 16:23.260
And then the one we want is called loggin required Mixon and you can basically think of this akin to

16:23.260 --> 16:29.590
the decorator so I'll show you the example of a decorator one where we're we said from Django da contrib

16:30.000 --> 16:40.700
a th da decorator's import loggin underscore required.

16:40.790 --> 16:46.160
So essentially back when you're dealing with function based views to actually get that sort of automated

16:46.160 --> 16:50.210
logging required functionality you had to use these decorators.

16:50.330 --> 16:55.850
But luckily a class space to use the analogy to that is using these mixdowns and these are essentially

16:55.850 --> 16:59.750
classes that we mix in to the classes we're inheriting with.

16:59.750 --> 17:04.600
So not only do we want to create value but we're going to mixin that log in required.

17:04.610 --> 17:06.260
That's kind of where they get their name from.

17:06.470 --> 17:09.860
So I'll say log in required Mixon Khama.

17:10.090 --> 17:13.280
So now I'm going to inherit methods from both of these classes.

17:13.370 --> 17:18.440
So not just create new but also logging required mixin in with the mixdowns they take in a couple of

17:18.440 --> 17:21.140
more attributes that are necessary.

17:21.140 --> 17:26.900
So one attribute we want to do is set up the log in you are all some cases persons not logged in.

17:27.070 --> 17:28.120
Where should they go.

17:28.120 --> 17:31.860
And later on we'll say they should go to slash logon.

17:31.930 --> 17:37.000
Almost like when you're setting up the static files and then we also want to do is have some sort of

17:37.000 --> 17:46.960
redirect field so that attribute is called redirects underscore field underscore name and I want to

17:46.960 --> 17:57.100
set that equal to blog slash post underscore detail dot h HVM L and what we're going to do is going

17:57.100 --> 17:57.670
to say.

17:57.670 --> 17:58.040
All right.

17:58.090 --> 18:08.590
So redirect them to the detailed view and then we'll say form class as equal to post form.

18:08.600 --> 18:10.870
But that means we actually need to import that.

18:10.910 --> 18:16.070
So I'm going to scroll back up here and we imported the models already let's actually import the forms

18:16.090 --> 18:27.740
themselves say from blog that forms in poor host form and import the comment form.

18:27.770 --> 18:29.020
So what does this all doing.

18:29.040 --> 18:31.920
Well I have the Create post view that we've seen before.

18:31.970 --> 18:36.320
We've seen it just to create view where you kind of have these models or these forms connected.

18:36.500 --> 18:41.740
But now I'm also kind of mixing in the slogging required just like I did with decorator's But this is

18:41.740 --> 18:45.070
kind of the class based view version also very easy to use.

18:45.080 --> 18:49.890
You just end up having these two fields where you want to read redirect or where the lock in your l

18:49.910 --> 18:51.440
should be.

18:51.460 --> 18:57.070
So we'll put those all in here and we will save that and we're going to come back to you or else that

18:57.070 --> 19:01.360
pi file and then match set up to some sort of your alcohol.

19:01.840 --> 19:12.040
So I will say your L and we'll say this says post and you can say post create but you're not limited

19:12.040 --> 19:14.800
to just saying create you can call this whatever you want.

19:14.800 --> 19:19.060
So oftentimes you're not going to want the your all to just always say create.

19:19.060 --> 19:22.870
Maybe you want your own specific thing especially of larger sites for users.

19:22.990 --> 19:26.450
In this case let's call this post new which kind of also makes sense.

19:27.650 --> 19:34.790
So say our posts slashed new and then over here what I'm going to do is say views die and I'm going

19:34.790 --> 19:46.350
to create a post that you underscore as you and then I will say name is equal to post underscore.

19:46.380 --> 19:50.800
You and I'm going to say that.

19:51.030 --> 19:54.050
So this is now my create post view.

19:54.300 --> 19:56.270
So let's continue on.

19:56.370 --> 20:02.250
I've been able to check out the details of a post create a post to my home page and then at my About

20:02.250 --> 20:06.360
page tech checking off a lot of these boxes on generic views.

20:06.360 --> 20:07.560
Let's continue on.

20:07.560 --> 20:09.800
A lot of times I'll probably want to update a post.

20:09.840 --> 20:12.460
Maybe I made a mistake so I don't want to just be able to create them.

20:12.480 --> 20:15.820
I want to update them which means coming back up here.

20:15.850 --> 20:18.760
Member This is all from those crud lectures.

20:18.820 --> 20:21.680
Going Say up the view.

20:21.820 --> 20:29.500
Scroll back down and then we'll create a new class and we'll call this post up.

20:29.600 --> 20:36.660
You and we'll have this also be loggin required makes sense if I need to actually update something I

20:36.660 --> 20:37.940
should be logged in.

20:38.340 --> 20:44.100
And then we'll call up that view and then this is going to the same log in your Arel and our field name

20:44.190 --> 20:46.230
as the creation of it.

20:46.260 --> 20:52.010
In fact it's actually going to have everything the same so we can just copy and paste this and whips

20:52.160 --> 20:55.770
out my colon and there it is.

20:55.780 --> 20:56.030
All right.

20:56.030 --> 21:00.990
So all these attributes are the same for update and creation which makes a lot of sense.

21:00.990 --> 21:04.460
Basically the only thing you're saying is OK now you're updating it instead of creating a brand new

21:04.460 --> 21:04.910
one.

21:05.060 --> 21:09.180
Which kind of has to do with whether or not you're creating new primary key or linking to an old one.

21:09.320 --> 21:15.360
So same thing has always come back to your not pie hopefully or begin it's kind of fill out the pattern

21:15.360 --> 21:19.090
of what we're doing here and we'll start some regular expressions.

21:19.200 --> 21:25.690
So I'll say this is post and actually this should be you should have carrots on them.

21:25.690 --> 21:28.740
So I apologize that I forgot about that.

21:28.930 --> 21:29.670
But there we go.

21:29.670 --> 21:37.480
These were off carrots now and then what we're gonna say is for the post up they will say post slash

21:37.630 --> 21:41.870
and then I'm going to call the same sort of primary key.

21:42.440 --> 21:48.550
To make sure it matches the primary key essentially just making sure you link to the correct one.

21:48.630 --> 21:56.250
And then let's say something like slash at and then we'll have a dollar sign here so I'm going say something

21:56.250 --> 22:04.650
like oh post number one at that post and then we'll say Khama views thoughts and then I should have

22:04.680 --> 22:07.490
a post up that you.

22:07.700 --> 22:13.050
There it is as always in your column as View.

22:13.270 --> 22:18.480
And then we'll give it some sort of name and let's call this name post underscore at it you can have

22:18.520 --> 22:20.290
us call the post up.

22:20.400 --> 22:23.860
If you just remember that name and match it or I call post at it.

22:24.580 --> 22:25.130
OK.

22:25.150 --> 22:27.780
Almost none of the post use.

22:27.880 --> 22:35.330
Coming back to views that pi I have right now my creating updating detailed view listing view about

22:35.410 --> 22:36.090
you.

22:36.130 --> 22:38.270
This is all just for the blog posts.

22:38.530 --> 22:42.240
And then what I also want is to take care of the drafts.

22:42.430 --> 22:47.550
So remember I publish posts but before they're published they're going to be drafts.

22:47.590 --> 22:54.500
So let's actually create a view that lists all my unpublished drafts which means I'm going to create

22:54.500 --> 23:00.540
a class and actually before we do that let's kind of sneak in a simpler one.

23:00.550 --> 23:02.320
What if I want to delete a post.

23:02.530 --> 23:08.640
I'll need a post delete you and I will take care of that draft in just a second.

23:08.960 --> 23:13.740
But this should also be log in required and this is going to inherit from the view.

23:13.790 --> 23:17.000
We have an important so let's do that as well.

23:17.000 --> 23:18.730
So update delete.

23:18.790 --> 23:26.120
And if this is confusing you definitely check out the crud lecture inside of the advanced class lecture

23:26.430 --> 23:27.790
or section I should say.

23:28.100 --> 23:30.200
OK so here's class Postol view.

23:30.320 --> 23:31.880
Logging required mixin.

23:32.090 --> 23:36.640
And then I'm going to call you this is a really simple one.

23:36.650 --> 23:40.670
We just connect it to the model that we're going to be the leading from and then we need some sort of

23:40.670 --> 23:41.170
success.

23:41.180 --> 23:44.680
You are all so hopefully remember this as well.

23:44.750 --> 23:46.160
So what happens when you actually delete it.

23:46.160 --> 23:47.540
Where should it go.

23:47.600 --> 23:52.910
And remember that when you're deleting have you you don't want the success you are l to actually activate

23:53.030 --> 23:54.370
until you delete it.

23:54.410 --> 23:59.410
Otherwise what kind of be jumping always to another Web site or another page on your website.

23:59.420 --> 24:03.230
I should say in order to do this we need to use the reverse lazy.

24:03.230 --> 24:14.410
So again scrolling all the way back up here will say from jingo your Elle's import reverse underscore

24:14.800 --> 24:15.670
lazy.

24:15.670 --> 24:21.070
That way it waits until you've actually deleted it to give you back the success you are ill that you're

24:21.070 --> 24:22.290
going to be going to.

24:22.570 --> 24:29.770
So we'll have it go back to the home page which is going to call reverse lazy and then we'll pass and

24:29.780 --> 24:33.860
the post underscore lists and I will say that.

24:34.210 --> 24:35.770
OK so let's delete view.

24:35.780 --> 24:38.710
And that basically takes care of our crud.

24:38.990 --> 24:45.110
This sort of creates updating the actual retrieval process well that's just displaying it.

24:45.110 --> 24:47.570
So that's kind of inherent to all these slices and then deleting.

24:47.780 --> 24:50.120
So these are my credit views right here these three.

24:50.390 --> 24:55.280
And then I also have the detail list and about or a template I should say.

24:55.350 --> 24:55.810
OK.

24:55.940 --> 25:02.870
So come back to your old pie and her blog and I know there's a lot of code hopefully isn't seem super

25:02.870 --> 25:05.350
overwhelming if you saw this all at once.

25:05.350 --> 25:09.560
It would seem kind of crazy but I believe the way we're kind of structuring it out here.

25:09.680 --> 25:10.900
It shouldn't be so bad.

25:12.520 --> 25:14.330
And we just create the delete view.

25:14.650 --> 25:16.020
Let's set that up.

25:16.030 --> 25:21.670
So we'll say post underscore and are going to copy and paste this again.

25:24.720 --> 25:27.430
And then we will say slash and let's call it.

25:27.490 --> 25:37.770
I don't I'll call it remove dollar sign and then we'll call you use dots and this should be call post

25:37.860 --> 25:41.440
delete you there it is.

25:41.690 --> 25:42.860
And then we call it.

25:42.950 --> 25:49.060
View and we'll give it a name and we'll call this name so kind of matches up with the other one will

25:49.060 --> 25:52.700
say post remove comma.

25:53.060 --> 25:53.780
OK.

25:53.850 --> 25:55.850
Now you could always break this up into multiple lines.

25:55.860 --> 26:01.590
So a lot of people when at work of these you or else they kind of style them like this just so it's

26:01.590 --> 26:02.570
more readable.

26:02.610 --> 26:07.290
I'm going to follow along with the actual notes that I have for you guys where everything's on a single

26:07.290 --> 26:07.890
line.

26:08.050 --> 26:13.350
But keep in mind this isn't exactly the best pep 8 styling since it's going beyond the number of character

26:13.350 --> 26:14.880
limits here kind of line.

26:15.010 --> 26:16.210
It's a very faint line.

26:16.350 --> 26:21.090
But again I think it's a little easier to read if you just kind of scroll back and forth versus having

26:21.090 --> 26:22.830
everything on multiple lines.

26:22.830 --> 26:23.140
OK.

26:23.310 --> 26:26.830
Just a little side note coming back to you is that pie.

26:26.850 --> 26:32.300
We have one last class based of you will come over to use that pie and finish it.

26:33.970 --> 26:36.520
And that is that draft list I was mentioning.

26:36.670 --> 26:43.980
So let's create it will say draft's list of you and this is just another list view.

26:43.980 --> 26:49.920
So again I'm going to call a loggin required and this will look a lot like the post list view except

26:49.920 --> 26:57.220
it's going to have a query set specifying that I want to make sure the published day isn't there so

26:57.230 --> 27:02.140
will specify a log in the oral is equal to log in

27:06.270 --> 27:10.950
and then get some more lines and here I also want the redirect.

27:10.950 --> 27:22.420
So let's actually say the redirect field name is going to be equal to blogs slash posts underscore list

27:22.980 --> 27:27.430
HVM El and then connect to a model.

27:27.430 --> 27:29.240
The model is just going to be the post.

27:29.770 --> 27:33.670
And this looks basically exactly like the post list view.

27:33.670 --> 27:41.010
So if we jump back up to the post list view Remember I said for the post view get me stuff that's actually

27:41.010 --> 27:46.000
been published less than or equal to the times are now to kind of make sense you know and stuff.

27:46.300 --> 27:48.870
So you should publish just in case you get some more air that way.

27:48.870 --> 27:51.780
And then we also have the ordering of it in this case.

27:51.780 --> 27:56.560
If I scroll down for the drafts I want to also get a query set.

27:56.670 --> 28:00.660
But I want to make sure that there actually isn't a publication date on it.

28:02.630 --> 28:16.530
So I'll say the get queries sent pasand self and I will return post the objects that filter and I will

28:16.530 --> 28:23.710
grab that published dates underscore underscore and the method I'm going to use here is called is null

28:24.720 --> 28:26.000
and I'll set that equal to true.

28:26.000 --> 28:27.480
So what does that actually say.

28:27.710 --> 28:32.600
Well if this is a list of my drafts that I want to make sure that it doesn't actually have a publication

28:32.600 --> 28:35.350
date meaning I want is not true.

28:35.480 --> 28:46.870
And then we're going to do is offer that I will call order by and I'll order these by the created the.

28:46.930 --> 28:51.130
You could also say Dasch created they kind of up to you the pinning on how you think they should best

28:51.130 --> 28:52.210
be ordered.

28:52.210 --> 28:58.880
So we'll save that and then we make sure that my principles are balanced that pier times are now ordered

28:58.900 --> 29:06.660
by and it's I look at this post to you I should actually have in other parentheses here.

29:06.830 --> 29:07.190
OK.

29:07.270 --> 29:08.760
So that makes more sense.

29:08.770 --> 29:12.550
So I was getting some weird errors because there was some unbalanced Princie here.

29:12.580 --> 29:17.320
Let me scroll that way over here and delete that one.

29:17.320 --> 29:17.650
OK.

29:17.770 --> 29:23.410
So just a quick note I forgot to add this predeceased because it should be an entire filter command

29:23.860 --> 29:26.890
and then off of that should be entire order by command.

29:26.890 --> 29:31.550
So I was actually calling off the now instead of off the entire filter call.

29:31.560 --> 29:35.650
It's kind of more clear if we scroll down here we have this entire filter command and then we have this

29:35.650 --> 29:37.100
entire order by command.

29:37.450 --> 29:40.920
And last but not least we need to still add the draft list view.

29:41.260 --> 29:44.950
You are also again turning back to the API file.

29:45.160 --> 29:47.180
And let's hit it up.

29:47.200 --> 29:54.000
So let me make sure I have a comma here and I will say your L and hopefully on your screen this is a

29:54.000 --> 29:55.260
little more clear.

29:55.260 --> 30:01.890
Right now I'm zoomed in for you guys but on my screen I'm kind of program about myself and a zoomed

30:01.890 --> 30:02.540
in.

30:02.850 --> 30:07.860
So what I'm going to say is post and this is going to be for that draft list.

30:07.860 --> 30:16.570
So let's say for instance we want actually just make the stress keep it simple so traps are signed.

30:16.590 --> 30:23.050
So if we're ever go to drafts and I'm like then I'll be able to see all my dress and it's going to be

30:23.050 --> 30:31.610
views on the draft list of you since it's a class based for and to say it's view and let's give this

30:31.610 --> 30:32.180
a name.

30:32.180 --> 30:42.240
It's a really obvious name so don't forget it will say post draft list comma folks.

30:42.260 --> 30:47.200
So that is all the class based views were going to be working with in our project.

30:47.240 --> 30:48.530
Now I know I said that's all.

30:48.530 --> 30:50.240
But there's definitely quite a bit of them.

30:50.360 --> 30:53.380
Definitely take the time to review what we've done here.

30:54.230 --> 30:55.730
There is a lot of code.

30:55.910 --> 31:02.180
I mean basically we just wrote what about 46 lines plus all these specific or else about 50 lines of

31:02.180 --> 31:03.340
code stuff.

31:03.480 --> 31:09.230
We take the time review what we just did check with the notes make sure things matching exactly in case

31:09.230 --> 31:10.640
you run into any errors.

31:10.670 --> 31:14.210
I know we haven't actually been running the site but that's just to make sure you completely understand

31:14.600 --> 31:15.610
each of these views.

31:15.620 --> 31:19.100
Hopefully this all made basic sense.

31:19.100 --> 31:24.570
The main things that were near that we introduced was the ability to have this get queery set inside

31:24.620 --> 31:25.950
of these template views.

31:26.150 --> 31:31.270
And the other thing we introduced is if you scroll down this sort of logging required Mixon which is

31:31.270 --> 31:34.900
just analogous to those decorators that we've worked with before.

31:35.310 --> 31:40.120
OK I know these are really long lectures so definitely take some time walk around relax.

31:40.130 --> 31:41.090
You definitely earned it.

31:41.090 --> 31:43.380
After listening to all of this.

31:43.550 --> 31:45.300
Thanks and I'll see you at the next lecture.
