00:05.560 --> 00:10.600
Hello everyone and welcome back to part 8 of the blog clone project.

00:10.610 --> 00:14.120
So now we're going to continue on by filling out the rest of the templates.

00:14.120 --> 00:16.340
Let's hop over to the editor and get started.

00:16.600 --> 00:16.910
OK.

00:16.910 --> 00:18.610
Here I am at the editor.

00:18.650 --> 00:23.780
I have the base studies team l file open here and what I'm going to be doing is opening up the rest

00:23.780 --> 00:28.730
of these team files and I can double click on them to open them up in new tabs I'm going to do that

00:29.270 --> 00:35.240
and then and basically all of these what we're gonna be doing is extending from the blog base raised

00:35.240 --> 00:41.600
him L. so have already here in the About page so it's collapses directory tree and put the Slyne in

00:41.600 --> 00:47.950
all of these since we're going to be sending from baseline T.M. for all of these.

00:47.960 --> 00:51.200
And we see as files so we don't need to put it there.

00:52.190 --> 00:52.830
OK.

00:53.000 --> 00:57.490
So let's start off with probably the simplest page is going to be our About page.

00:57.620 --> 01:03.260
So in this about page is just an empty template and you can really put whatever you want here but we're

01:03.260 --> 01:06.470
going to add in a call to the content block.

01:07.610 --> 01:15.350
So say content and then we're going to end that block say and the block and then here you can just put

01:15.350 --> 01:16.130
whatever you want.

01:16.140 --> 01:17.230
Just keep things simple.

01:17.220 --> 01:22.130
We'll have an H1 heading and I will say about this company.

01:22.130 --> 01:23.570
Or you can say about me the pending.

01:23.580 --> 01:31.290
That's a personal blog and then I'll say thanks for checking it out and maybe you could put in a Jumbotron

01:31.290 --> 01:40.210
a thing etc. but we're going to do is copy and paste this real quick and grab this block call and LME

01:40.220 --> 01:41.730
delete the end block.

01:41.750 --> 01:47.640
And I'm also going to pace that into all the rest the aged him else to set up the actual blocks.

01:47.810 --> 01:50.010
So we'll do that as well.

01:50.090 --> 01:56.520
Wups and that's because we're going to be using that in essentially every single page him Al file since

01:56.520 --> 01:59.860
that includes the nav bar itself.

01:59.970 --> 02:01.770
So we'll do that and all of these.

02:02.190 --> 02:02.660
OK.

02:02.940 --> 02:09.910
So let me go across the board and save these and the next one I'm going to work on is post list.

02:09.940 --> 02:15.100
Remember post lists is just the list the view that lists all the posts so it should be pretty simple

02:15.100 --> 02:15.990
to work with.

02:16.030 --> 02:22.510
We're going to do is after calling block content I'm going to create a DIV tag here called center stage

02:23.110 --> 02:25.790
and that's going to allow me to kind of center these a little more.

02:25.990 --> 02:34.840
And so over here and blog about C Ss I will create something as a new class called center stage where

02:34.870 --> 02:44.010
anything inside this center stage I'll call margin left to be auto to center it as well as margin right.

02:44.050 --> 02:48.070
And you could also just call it margin auto but this kind of just to make it a little more clear what

02:48.070 --> 02:49.400
center stage is about.

02:49.560 --> 02:54.890
And hopefully the name is also pretty clear but will have that this isn't necessary you don't need to

02:54.890 --> 02:55.340
do that.

02:55.370 --> 02:57.430
We'll just kind of be offset if you don't.

02:57.740 --> 03:01.530
And we're going to do is have a for loop with Django template.

03:01.700 --> 03:07.280
So say for post in or remember the default is post list whenever you were a fatalist view.

03:07.280 --> 03:13.140
It's that name of that model underscore list and then when you have the four you've got to have the.

03:13.220 --> 03:21.580
And the four and then we're going to do is let's create another div and we'll have this be the class

03:21.580 --> 03:28.420
post in case we ever want to do anything with it and we'll say H-1 have a link here.

03:28.720 --> 03:36.730
And this is going to be a moral effect let's make sure that template tag Yoro and Ill take us to the

03:36.730 --> 03:38.160
post detail.

03:39.270 --> 03:47.970
Page with the piquet primary key equal to post-up piquet and essentially it is going to do is add in

03:48.810 --> 03:51.570
the temple injection here of post-Idol.

03:51.810 --> 03:57.180
And this says OK if you are able to click on that post-Idol since it's an anchor tag it's going to take

03:57.180 --> 04:03.810
you to that post detail where the primary key of that post detail is equal to postop Piquet or post

04:03.870 --> 04:08.240
is being returned for Postum post list.

04:08.430 --> 04:15.270
And then after that let's create another div and we'll give this the date class we may or may not use

04:15.270 --> 04:22.260
it just kind of keeping us organized here and then we'll have a paragraph that says published on and

04:22.260 --> 04:23.700
then we're going to have the date.

04:23.940 --> 04:31.330
So I'll say post the published and then I'm going to use some template filters and remember that's basically

04:31.570 --> 04:37.990
string functions or date time functions that are from Python and you can use them with template injections

04:38.380 --> 04:45.970
and I'd like to use date just for some formatting here so I'll say a capital D space am y.

04:45.970 --> 04:50.830
And note the spacing here you sometimes get errors if everything here isn't touching together.

04:50.830 --> 04:52.350
So there's no spaces here.

04:53.560 --> 05:03.010
And then finally what I can do is after that div I'll create one more anchor tag that links to the comments

05:04.150 --> 05:15.830
so I'll say here you are I'll post underscore detail Piquet is equal to postop Piquet's to the exact

05:15.830 --> 05:21.260
same thing wrote there and then I'm going to say have some comments.

05:23.010 --> 05:25.230
Leps comments.

05:25.270 --> 05:37.000
And then what I'm going to do is inject the comic counts so I'll say post approve underscore comments

05:37.090 --> 05:41.900
and then what I can call for that is the kind of count attribute or count method.

05:41.920 --> 05:44.640
So if you go back to the blog post wups page.

05:44.770 --> 05:49.840
Basically what this is saying is if I were to click where it says comments won or comments too it would

05:49.840 --> 05:51.630
take me back to that post detail page.

05:51.700 --> 05:55.690
Just like clicking the title would which kind of make sense because if I click on comments I probably

05:55.690 --> 06:00.460
want to see the detail page that actually has the list of those comments and that's it for the post

06:00.460 --> 06:01.350
list page.

06:01.450 --> 06:03.800
And this is essentially our home page for the Web site.

06:03.880 --> 06:05.450
So we're all done with this now.

06:05.590 --> 06:12.330
So let's go ahead and pretend someone clicked on it which would bring him over to the post detail page.

06:12.570 --> 06:14.980
And this is going to be from a detail view.

06:15.300 --> 06:16.940
So let's get started on this one.

06:16.980 --> 06:21.330
So we're going to be probably one of the more complicated views or at least the view that has a lot

06:21.330 --> 06:22.730
of content with it.

06:23.220 --> 06:33.410
So we're going to create inside of this block in H-1 tag and we'll give it the class we'll give it the

06:33.410 --> 06:41.460
class equal to will say post-Idol and then we'll say lower here.

06:41.460 --> 06:45.640
So remember Lowder is that coloring class Sophie come back then here.

06:45.760 --> 06:51.850
Lowder That way the actual colors change and we'll show later on a kind of a quick fix to get everything

06:51.850 --> 06:56.210
to change color especially the highlighting which is essentially just coming back to the baseline each

06:56.210 --> 06:57.040
symbol.

06:57.060 --> 07:04.560
And over here you go to body you can just call class and then say loader here which is going to add

07:04.560 --> 07:05.730
a lot more coloring effects.

07:05.730 --> 07:10.930
Now be careful of this because you don't want to set everything to have like the background color.

07:10.950 --> 07:14.580
So make sure this is set to color OK.

07:14.850 --> 07:18.730
Coming back to the post the page after doing those changes.

07:18.900 --> 07:27.950
What I'm going to do is have the heading 1 be the title of the post and then what I'm going to do is

07:28.070 --> 07:36.370
have an if statement that says if the Post published date

07:39.100 --> 07:46.410
I will say else and then I'll have an end.

07:46.740 --> 07:51.820
Just to kind of set up my logic.

07:52.540 --> 07:57.420
OK so what are we going to do if the Post published they meaning there's some sort of publication.

07:57.800 --> 08:00.350
Then I'll create some sort of class here.

08:00.410 --> 08:07.520
Pasand day the post day and then I'm going to inject the postop published date

08:11.740 --> 08:15.790
else which means it's not published or going to do is say.

08:15.780 --> 08:16.850
Else.

08:17.110 --> 08:19.370
And have a button here.

08:19.480 --> 08:21.150
So this button is going to be.

08:21.400 --> 08:22.620
We'll give it a class.

08:22.810 --> 08:23.890
So it looks nicer.

08:25.320 --> 08:28.480
We'll say between beats and the fall.

08:28.700 --> 08:34.170
Just one of those bootstrap classes and what it's going to link to is a button that asks you oh you

08:34.170 --> 08:40.230
want to publish this or not because it does have a published date meaning that it passes if test it

08:40.230 --> 08:41.310
hasn't been published yet.

08:41.400 --> 08:47.860
So we're going to do is if you click on that publish button I'll take it to you or El to the Post

08:50.450 --> 08:55.830
publish where your primary key is the post-primary key.

08:56.090 --> 08:56.780
There we have it.

08:56.870 --> 08:57.870
And then we're going to end this.

08:57.980 --> 08:59.260
So let's save that.

08:59.480 --> 09:04.670
And then after that once that little post-Idol is done or you have the publish button all we're gonna

09:04.670 --> 09:14.240
do is add in a paragraph here with the class equal to post content and we'll be adding these classes

09:14.240 --> 09:16.220
to the C S S file later on.

09:16.220 --> 09:18.350
Some of them we won't use some of them we will.

09:18.350 --> 09:22.190
I always think it's a good idea to add in more classes than you may need.

09:22.250 --> 09:27.500
And then once you fill that CSSA and your website looks good you can then go Ramoo classes but it's

09:27.500 --> 09:31.460
really helpful for organizations have these classes here whether or not you're going to use them right

09:31.460 --> 09:31.980
away.

09:33.770 --> 09:40.240
And what's going to be here is going to have the post title and then we're going to have a safe on it.

09:40.490 --> 09:46.340
And basically what safe does is since we're going to be using that medium javascript editor if we select

09:46.340 --> 09:49.240
something as bold we won't want it to show up.

09:49.280 --> 09:55.960
For instance in the Web site looking like this like oh bold text with the tags.

09:56.010 --> 10:01.710
So if I don't have safe here and I've affected it using the medium editor it's going to look like this

10:01.770 --> 10:07.140
included the tags if I have save that it's going to translate that is T.M. to actually look like we

10:07.140 --> 10:09.820
expect it to look.

10:10.050 --> 10:14.020
And if that doesn't really make sense you can basically just take off safe here and they'll immediately

10:14.020 --> 10:16.490
make sense as far as what I'm trying to convey.

10:16.720 --> 10:25.340
And then we're going to do is call one more says line breaks B.R. which essentially there's a line break.

10:25.360 --> 10:27.280
The team Elbel so-called break there.

10:29.440 --> 10:32.610
And then we're going to have another statement that's going to check that the user's authenticator not

10:32.680 --> 10:33.080
souls.

10:33.130 --> 10:39.570
If user is authenticated we're going to do some stuff.

10:39.580 --> 10:46.210
But as always if you've got to END-IF so to create some new lines here.

10:46.550 --> 10:47.910
So these are authenticated.

10:47.930 --> 10:53.270
We should probably have something or let's say a two buttons one to edit the post in one to remove the

10:53.270 --> 10:53.950
post.

10:54.320 --> 10:58.130
So the first line is going to be an anchor tag and we'll give it a class

11:01.210 --> 11:04.480
and the class is going to be a primary button.

11:04.750 --> 11:08.170
So say between space between primary

11:12.390 --> 11:19.130
and then we'll your L posts underscore it will pass and the primary key is equal to the post-primary

11:19.140 --> 11:19.730
keygen.

11:19.890 --> 11:26.410
Just as we them before and then we're also going to inserts inside of this icon.

11:26.490 --> 11:27.840
So let's do that.

11:28.050 --> 11:34.630
We'll use a span tag for that will say span and we just have to give it a class.

11:35.040 --> 11:42.430
So the class we're going to say is this glyph icon or Cliffie Econ. the penny how you pronounce it.

11:42.560 --> 11:44.410
And then another glyph icon

11:47.250 --> 11:49.970
Pensil.

11:50.020 --> 11:51.910
So that's going to look like a little pencil.

11:51.910 --> 11:56.770
So in case you want to actually edit the post you click on the pencil icon then I'm going to copy this

11:56.810 --> 11:59.120
and let's do another one for removing the post.

11:59.400 --> 12:07.610
So instead of it it will take you to post remove and then instead of a pencil glyph icon sort of we're

12:07.610 --> 12:11.690
going to just say remove which is a little X..

12:11.690 --> 12:12.090
OK.

12:12.320 --> 12:14.080
So that's all we need to do there.

12:14.120 --> 12:18.150
Let's continue on song.

12:18.240 --> 12:19.960
Kind of a separator here.

12:21.520 --> 12:26.060
I'll say actually you can do a horizontal break there.

12:27.570 --> 12:34.260
Or horizontal row and then we're going to say is have a class here and let's have a button that allows

12:34.260 --> 12:36.000
us to add comments.

12:36.000 --> 12:48.010
So I'll say this is an H ref that takes it to your L that is add comment to post with the primary key

12:49.430 --> 12:53.450
being equal to the post-primary key.

12:53.510 --> 12:55.100
Let's actually get the bootstrap class.

12:55.100 --> 12:56.330
It looks nice.

12:57.550 --> 13:02.770
We can say something like between beats and primary wups

13:05.420 --> 13:08.150
PTEN comments.

13:08.180 --> 13:14.280
So if we ever want to do stuff we can add it to that and then coming over to the right we have add comments.

13:14.290 --> 13:20.320
Post and let's have some actual something in this link that says like add comments.

13:20.590 --> 13:26.110
So we'll save that and then I'm going to put everything else here inside of a container class.

13:26.200 --> 13:32.080
Everything that's left and basically inside this container is going to be the list of the comments.

13:32.080 --> 13:38.680
So I'll say for comments in postop comments.

13:38.720 --> 13:43.830
All and because I have this I want to and for.

13:43.930 --> 13:53.460
So it's now well say and for and that after that we're going to do is absolutely close that in we're

13:53.460 --> 13:56.010
going to end up doing is saying this.

13:56.010 --> 14:00.810
So for every comma and post-doc comments I'm going to add in the break that we've got a little bit of

14:00.810 --> 14:06.020
space and then another check of the user's authenticated or at the comma is an approved comment.

14:06.090 --> 14:08.250
Otherwise I don't really want to display it.

14:08.760 --> 14:13.040
So I'm going to say if the user is authenticated

14:15.450 --> 14:24.300
or the comments isn't approved comments going back with that model and since I have an if statement

14:24.360 --> 14:27.080
it's a good idea to just take care of the END-IF right now.

14:28.200 --> 14:33.540
I'm going to pass in the comments created day so let's inject that in a comment.

14:34.570 --> 14:48.210
Created underscore dates and they want to do is say if nots comments prove prove underscore comments

14:48.420 --> 14:49.980
all have two buttons here.

14:49.980 --> 14:53.270
One to remove the comment and then one to approve the comment.

14:53.280 --> 14:55.440
This is going to be really similar to what I have here.

14:55.440 --> 14:56.760
So it's going to copy and paste these

15:00.350 --> 15:01.670
and let's line these up.

15:01.670 --> 15:07.400
So I need to add this.

15:07.520 --> 15:11.790
So here at the end this tab these and so they look a little more clear.

15:12.990 --> 15:14.790
And I like to paste isn't.

15:14.790 --> 15:19.840
So let me give this one more here and it's copy and paste this one more time.

15:22.520 --> 15:29.840
And then here will have remove but instead of a post remove it's going to be a comments remove and a

15:29.840 --> 15:35.890
sort of a poster to move here or actually you can just say this is comments or move instead.

15:36.330 --> 15:42.200
So at the top on the comment remove So comment remove Piquet is the comments

15:45.990 --> 15:51.870
primary key and then this Spanish class will just have it be removed so that stays the same and we can

15:51.870 --> 15:58.180
have this being said of a primary button the default button and then the second one is going to be in

15:58.180 --> 15:58.750
approval.

15:58.780 --> 16:07.200
So instead of saying Kamens remove all change it common to prove so common to prove and the piquet does

16:07.200 --> 16:07.850
need to be.

16:07.850 --> 16:08.480
Comments.

16:08.510 --> 16:15.030
Piquet's well and then the other one is going to have to be Cliffie Khan and you can really choose any

16:15.210 --> 16:19.140
clip icons you want but we'll just say OK.

16:19.260 --> 16:19.770
All right.

16:20.030 --> 16:25.110
So a little if statement to kind of check everything's OK as far as what buttons we show.

16:25.110 --> 16:31.600
And then below that I'm going to actually add in the information with some paragraph tags where I will

16:31.600 --> 16:35.740
say put in the actual text of the comments.

16:36.990 --> 16:46.690
Pass it through Safe case to use any special T.M. and then say line breaks so that we actually take

16:46.690 --> 16:53.710
care of new line breaks and below that we'll add in one more paragraph tag or this paragraph tag is

16:53.710 --> 16:55.910
going to say who is posted by.

16:55.910 --> 16:57.170
So I posted my.

16:57.320 --> 17:06.830
And then going to inject the comments author and we can passen as bold if we want but that's it.

17:07.150 --> 17:13.030
And then what we can do is in between this and if this and for have a template tag to check if something's

17:13.030 --> 17:18.020
empty meaning if there was nothing in the post comments at all.

17:18.250 --> 17:19.380
We'll just say ok.

17:19.470 --> 17:20.340
Empty.

17:20.510 --> 17:28.010
And then it's a nice easy tag call for if this is empty what you can post in this case will say no comments.

17:28.020 --> 17:32.400
OK so this was definitely one of the most complicated views we had to do throughout the entire project

17:32.400 --> 17:34.050
so let's quickly go over it.

17:34.050 --> 17:38.160
And if you want to actually reference any of this I'd highly recommend the kind of just copy and paste

17:38.430 --> 17:42.180
from the notes provided to make sure everything matches because there's a lot of stuff we could have

17:42.180 --> 17:43.590
possibly gone wrong here.

17:43.690 --> 17:49.350
But essentially all we're doing is we're saying OK put in the post title if the Post has a publication

17:49.350 --> 17:50.090
date.

17:50.160 --> 17:54.290
Start the post date and then actually place it the publication date.

17:54.690 --> 17:58.570
Else we're going to have a button here that says hey do you want to publish this.

17:58.710 --> 18:04.640
And they'll take it to the Post publish page after that you have the actual post content which you start

18:04.640 --> 18:06.230
off with just the post title.

18:06.230 --> 18:10.530
Make sure it's safe and then have the line breaks if these are authenticated.

18:10.600 --> 18:14.360
There are going to be able to edit the post or remove the post.

18:14.360 --> 18:16.580
So that's what this block of code is doing.

18:16.580 --> 18:19.610
Below that we're going to be able to add comments to the post.

18:19.790 --> 18:24.170
And in this case we have this container for all the comments that are released to that post because

18:24.170 --> 18:24.820
we are postop.

18:24.820 --> 18:25.560
OK.

18:25.730 --> 18:30.410
If the user is authenticated or the comments and approved comments we're going to show the creation

18:30.410 --> 18:30.980
date.

18:31.180 --> 18:35.870
If the comma is not an approved comment so I'm logged then I should still be able to see these comments

18:35.870 --> 18:37.580
but they're not approved.

18:37.580 --> 18:41.600
I can either remove the comments or give it the OK that it's been approved.

18:42.080 --> 18:47.930
And then once that's done we're going to show the common text safe with line breaks and then show who

18:47.930 --> 18:49.010
actually posted that comment.

18:49.010 --> 18:51.590
So that's actually all this post the tail is doing.

18:51.590 --> 18:52.610
So lots of code.

18:52.610 --> 18:54.550
But the idea is pretty straightforward.

18:54.830 --> 18:55.590
OK.

18:56.150 --> 18:58.260
We'll continue on this in the next lecture.

18:58.310 --> 18:59.900
We go the other templates.

18:59.930 --> 19:01.270
Thanks and I'll see you there.
