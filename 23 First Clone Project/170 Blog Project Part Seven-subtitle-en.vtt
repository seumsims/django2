00:05.610 --> 00:11.760
Hill every want to walk up to part seven of the blog and project it's finally time to actually start

00:11.790 --> 00:16.260
filling up all those email templates that we've created in the previous lectures and we're going to

00:16.260 --> 00:18.700
start off with the base HTL templates.

00:18.700 --> 00:23.190
So that's the one we're going to be using by extending it to all the other templates and we'll also

00:23.190 --> 00:25.950
be setting up some of the C Ss and Javascript calls.

00:25.950 --> 00:28.620
We're going to be making through up to future lectures.

00:28.620 --> 00:33.900
Let's get started by helping the editor and also be showing you the resources in the browser so we're

00:33.900 --> 00:35.930
kind of back and forth between those.

00:35.940 --> 00:36.980
Let's get started.

00:37.280 --> 00:37.680
All right.

00:37.680 --> 00:41.670
Here I am at the editor and I opened up the base that each team l file.

00:41.670 --> 00:43.860
So far we don't really have anything in it.

00:43.860 --> 00:50.610
We just have this doc type H Tim L and I've gone ahead and added load static files that way I can reference

00:50.610 --> 00:54.720
things such as the blog CSSA file we did using template tagging.

00:54.720 --> 00:56.960
So I can say that static template tag.

00:57.210 --> 01:01.530
So coming back to the base that each team l we're going to add some stuff to this.

01:01.530 --> 01:08.840
So the things to add after adding a title is bootstrap saw type that in as comments so I want to add

01:08.840 --> 01:10.220
in Bootstrap.

01:10.220 --> 01:16.880
I also want to add in this medium style editor and that's going to be the thing that allows us to kind

01:16.880 --> 01:21.900
of mimic medium calm editing and we'll show you what that means in just a second.

01:21.920 --> 01:27.930
We also want to have some custom CSX and then probably some Google fonts as well.

01:28.210 --> 01:30.190
So we'll grab those as well.

01:30.520 --> 01:36.880
And then the other thing that I want is over here in the body will probably want a nav bar eventually

01:37.470 --> 01:39.550
so I'll be adding that in this lecture.

01:39.730 --> 01:47.140
And then since this is going to be the base likes him will probably also have some content so I'll have

01:47.140 --> 01:49.090
some sort of body block here.

01:49.140 --> 01:53.980
I believe you called it the concept block so we'll call it concept block.

01:53.980 --> 01:58.990
OK so let's say that and let's come back up here and show you the resources and how to grab the rethinks

01:59.050 --> 01:59.950
for bootstrap.

01:59.950 --> 02:03.920
We've done this a bunch of times before but just come over here to get bootstrapped back.

02:04.240 --> 02:07.280
And then I'm going to grab these CD ends.

02:07.440 --> 02:10.520
I will copy this and then I'm going to paste it here.

02:13.490 --> 02:18.230
And here we can see the latest bit if I see a SS and also an optional theme is what I've copied and

02:18.230 --> 02:20.180
pasted those are the only two lines we need.

02:20.180 --> 02:23.610
And then the collapse directory tree to get myself a little more room.

02:23.660 --> 02:27.170
Now the next thing we're going to add in is the medium style editor.

02:27.170 --> 02:31.940
So in case you're not familiar medium dot com Let me show you what that looks like and then we'll explore

02:31.940 --> 02:36.760
some hub libraries that are open source for us to use to mimic this song.

02:36.770 --> 02:41.090
Hop over to my browser here and close this get bootstrap.

02:41.510 --> 02:44.830
And here we can see a page if you go all the way atop.

02:44.900 --> 02:45.760
Check out these links.

02:45.770 --> 02:53.150
But it's just that the user Y A B W e slash and then the medium Ed. And you can see is actually a library

02:53.150 --> 02:54.380
that has a ton of commits.

02:54.380 --> 02:57.570
It's actually updated pretty recently as far as this feeling.

02:57.580 --> 02:59.820
At least a month ago it was updated.

03:00.020 --> 03:04.220
And if you keep scrolling down you'll see it it supports most major browsers but to actually get an

03:04.220 --> 03:09.170
understanding of what this is I'm going to go to medium dot com to kind of show you.

03:09.210 --> 03:12.120
So if you're go to medium com right now I'm logged then.

03:12.120 --> 03:18.270
So I can see particular articles that median dot com is basically where anyone can just write an article

03:18.270 --> 03:21.870
or a blog and everything has the same style and formatting.

03:21.870 --> 03:25.720
So if we click on one of these articles such as this one how machines make sense of big data.

03:25.950 --> 03:30.270
Obviously you can tell that I follow a lot of data science and technology articles you'll click on it

03:30.360 --> 03:36.450
then it looks something like this in every article or blog on a medium that basically has the same look

03:36.450 --> 03:41.620
and feel you have images and you have this text editor and you have kind of these wide margins.

03:41.700 --> 03:45.630
So it looks kind of like a blog post.

03:45.860 --> 03:49.880
And if you want to write your own story you click here and write story after you've logged in and then

03:49.880 --> 03:55.550
you have the sort of editor to say some stuff here and then you can highlight this and it gives you

03:55.550 --> 04:02.870
the option to either make it bolds make it a taluk head or one heading to where you can put a link here

04:02.870 --> 04:09.170
and then say I don't know Google dot com etc. and they can see it's underlined and now it's a link.

04:09.170 --> 04:12.520
So that's the kind of thing we want to mimic in our own blog posts.

04:12.590 --> 04:17.210
So if we come over here after some searching I was able to discover that a lot of people wanted the

04:17.210 --> 04:21.730
sort of functionality and it's already here for a client for us to use.

04:21.800 --> 04:25.490
And if you scroll all the way down you want to make sure that whenever you're working with open source

04:25.490 --> 04:31.890
files that you found online that there is some sort of license agreement so we check on the license

04:31.890 --> 04:34.650
make sure that we have permission to actually use this.

04:34.660 --> 04:39.990
Now I'm just using this for educational purposes so you can see that this is copyright but there's also

04:39.990 --> 04:45.390
a particular license so there's permission free of charge to any person obtaining a copy of the software

04:45.690 --> 04:48.600
to deal in the software or any sort of restrictions.

04:48.600 --> 04:50.790
And then is subject to the following conditions.

04:50.940 --> 04:56.970
Usually the conditions are for you just to source an attribute who you actually got this from.

04:56.970 --> 05:01.970
So here's the actual information here on this license we're just doing this for educational purposes.

05:02.170 --> 05:06.000
But whenever you're doing something in a production you should always make sure that you have the rights

05:06.000 --> 05:07.710
to this software.

05:07.710 --> 05:12.390
Obviously things are hosted on get hub in their open source things and get a little fuzzy if you ever

05:12.390 --> 05:15.600
have any doubt you'll get the message to the person directly.

05:16.660 --> 05:19.970
Coming back to the actual whoops let's go back here.

05:19.970 --> 05:24.730
Are you coming back to the actual medium Ed. home page here on the hub we can see that if you scroll

05:24.730 --> 05:25.490
down.

05:25.960 --> 05:31.170
It's essentially a javascript library that mimics exactly what the medium Viacom was doing.

05:31.180 --> 05:36.850
It has modern browser support which is good and it shows you some basic demos on basic usage.

05:37.000 --> 05:41.620
So we're going to be doing is using this for text area and eventually you click on the demos you'll

05:41.620 --> 05:43.200
find this demo.

05:43.210 --> 05:48.580
So this under medium Ed. demo text area h team L and you can see that after you've imported and linked

05:48.580 --> 05:54.850
everything the javascript in the CSSA you just have to create this script here to create a new editor

05:54.850 --> 05:55.600
object.

05:55.600 --> 06:01.120
And you also have to make sure that has this class this editable medium Ed. text area which we actually

06:01.120 --> 06:07.030
did back when we were creating that we just dictionary attribute in the forms classes and then coming

06:07.030 --> 06:14.200
down here we can see that there's various ways to actually add this in as a file in our project.

06:14.320 --> 06:18.460
And there's a service called JSE deliver which kind of acts like an external CDN.

06:18.700 --> 06:23.710
So if you don't actually want to download everything and link it up manually you can just copy and paste

06:23.800 --> 06:25.180
these two right here.

06:25.240 --> 06:30.030
So one is a javascript file and then one is the CSSA link file so I'm going to do that.

06:30.070 --> 06:34.690
The other option is if you're having trouble getting the CD ends to work then just do the manual installation

06:35.080 --> 06:36.650
which you just scroll down here.

06:37.220 --> 06:41.810
And then you click down where it says latest releases will take it to the latest release page and then

06:41.810 --> 06:44.580
I'll say OK is 5.2 3.0.

06:44.870 --> 06:47.490
And then we can do is find there all the information about that.

06:47.510 --> 06:52.400
And then just download the source code itself and then just use the linking which we already learned

06:52.400 --> 06:56.390
about HTL to link the javascript and CSSA files.

06:56.390 --> 07:02.700
So I'll come back here to my editor and I'm going to copy and paste that medium style editor.

07:02.750 --> 07:04.960
So there's only two things there is that javascript.

07:05.090 --> 07:08.270
And then there's this C Ss So coming back around here.

07:08.510 --> 07:13.270
Those are the two links I'm going to need to actually implement the medium style editing and later I

07:13.280 --> 07:18.350
will see the template tags I had to set up that widget class and then also call that script that we

07:18.350 --> 07:19.610
kind of just talked about.

07:20.030 --> 07:26.930
Then finally for some custom CSSA make sure that any custom C Ss goes after all these other CSSA calls

07:27.370 --> 07:33.110
and I'm going to link it here to this blog that si SS So luckily I've already inputted static files

07:33.170 --> 07:37.040
meaning I can just say add a link here.

07:37.300 --> 07:41.860
It's a style sheet and then from a trip on you use static template tagging which you've seen before

07:42.980 --> 07:50.340
and just say static and then call something like see SS blog about CSSA.

07:50.360 --> 07:52.340
Because if I look at her Churi that's where it is.

07:52.340 --> 07:56.060
We have static C S S log that t ss and right now.

07:56.060 --> 08:01.760
Our blog about C Ss is empty and if you remember back to what the blog actually looks like we have those

08:02.060 --> 08:07.290
sort of color changes that the text does and I'll show you how I discover that.

08:07.730 --> 08:12.080
So what's a really fun Web site to check out which we probably mentioned the very beginning in the course

08:12.080 --> 08:16.060
as a way to share your code for Front-End stuff is code Pendar.

08:16.100 --> 08:19.030
I know that c o d PTEN.

08:19.110 --> 08:26.090
I know and you can come here and there's lots of pens and essentially this is just really nice fun front

08:26.090 --> 08:26.570
end stuff.

08:26.570 --> 08:33.170
So using three Front-End technologies that's him LCAC us and Javascript and CSSA is actually really

08:33.170 --> 08:33.680
powerful.

08:33.680 --> 08:38.040
You can do a lot of C Ss that you would think would be limited to Javascript.

08:38.170 --> 08:43.690
So what I was doing I was just messing around code then I kind of wanted to add some nice CSSA this

08:44.230 --> 08:46.530
maybe something that was a little fun for the blog project.

08:46.540 --> 08:51.760
Eventually after searching these if you find something that interests you for instance maybe you want

08:51.760 --> 08:52.230
it.

08:52.420 --> 08:55.400
Well not the box solution that's all too crazy.

08:55.420 --> 09:01.010
Let's say you wanted to have this little guy this rainbow preload or so you click on this.

09:01.110 --> 09:04.260
You'll notice that it has noted it's only supported in Chrome.

09:04.400 --> 09:10.670
But if you wanted to add something like this to your site we could do just copy this VSS and then copy

09:10.670 --> 09:11.500
the same Elche.

09:11.530 --> 09:16.720
This is an example of how to use a CSSA and that would be an easy way to have that on your site.

09:16.850 --> 09:21.460
So I ended up doing is I discovered this little loading.

09:21.510 --> 09:28.160
So it's a simple loader and we can click on it and what it does is the background changes Hughes and

09:28.160 --> 09:31.400
I want it to instead of have the entire background change hues.

09:31.490 --> 09:37.070
I would have the letters themselves change hues and I didn't really care too much about these three

09:37.070 --> 09:38.660
dots that are loading.

09:38.660 --> 09:44.420
So basically what I want to grab is just the color changing and this was actually all done with SS So

09:44.420 --> 09:46.440
I'm going to copy and paste this.

09:46.610 --> 09:50.020
And since we're using this for educational purposes we don't have to worry too much.

09:50.030 --> 09:54.500
But the license but in case you want to use a file like this in production it's always a good idea to

09:54.530 --> 09:57.500
contact the creator and make sure that's OK with them.

09:57.500 --> 10:01.520
Obviously their hosting this all open source and there's no real license agreement here.

10:01.580 --> 10:03.470
We should always check and make sure.

10:03.470 --> 10:07.720
So all you do is copy this and note the class.

10:07.720 --> 10:13.050
It's the class loader and we're going to be kind of calling that on everything later on.

10:13.170 --> 10:17.700
So I'm going to come back here after copy and paste that and I'm just going to put that into our own

10:17.700 --> 10:24.100
blog about SS So will paste it here and then scroll back up.

10:24.280 --> 10:28.520
And I don't actually need the BE1 be to B-3 cetera.

10:28.800 --> 10:32.880
So all those were is if you kind of check out this.

10:32.880 --> 10:39.290
We had class B one B and B-3 that's for these three little loading bars.

10:39.300 --> 10:43.940
What I really want and am concerned with is just this loader and then these keyframes.

10:44.220 --> 10:52.350
So I'm going to get rid of these BE1 classes scroll all the way down and then kind of get rid of them

10:52.770 --> 10:55.400
just to simplify my CSSA script a little bit.

10:55.770 --> 11:00.360
And then what I want to do is last thing I don't want to change the background I just want to change

11:00.360 --> 11:07.300
the color and we'll be exploring this later on as we actually implement this OK.

11:07.620 --> 11:14.340
So there is my loader and we actually don't need this left right top either erroneous position or fix

11:14.340 --> 11:16.020
kind of simplifying this.

11:16.020 --> 11:18.300
These are the three things they only really care about.

11:18.350 --> 11:24.770
The hue rotates or it's actually coming from the linear gradient of the color and then the animation.

11:24.830 --> 11:31.400
So I will save this and then we'll see if we have this H-1 call which we can leave.

11:31.410 --> 11:36.200
We want it to but I'm actually going to get rid of it since we don't really need a heading one.

11:36.270 --> 11:40.510
So that was Felix over here this loading or somehow it's also changing.

11:40.620 --> 11:43.050
I don't really want that so going to say save it.

11:43.260 --> 11:48.930
So the main things I care about are loader and then keyframes if you keep the other stuff in you may

11:48.930 --> 11:52.950
get some different behavior than what we've seen in the blog so far.

11:52.950 --> 11:57.630
And after we've set up our blog about CSSA file with that extra code the last thing we have to do is

11:57.630 --> 11:58.940
set up Google fonts.

11:59.130 --> 12:05.050
So coming back to the browser I have Google fonts or Fahnestock Google dot com and I can search for

12:05.050 --> 12:06.230
the two fonts I used.

12:06.240 --> 12:09.170
Obviously have a lot of flexibility over which ones you want to use.

12:09.210 --> 12:12.170
I use one called The Russo one look kind of interesting to me.

12:12.420 --> 12:17.770
And then I also use one of my favorite fonts This maps Mazzara.

12:17.810 --> 12:20.050
And then we're going to add that as well.

12:20.210 --> 12:25.390
Two families are selected to open that up and then copy and paste the link here.

12:26.430 --> 12:30.140
So I'm going to copy that and insert that into fonts.

12:30.240 --> 12:33.330
And now I have the stylesheets OK.

12:33.430 --> 12:34.130
Perfect.

12:34.150 --> 12:36.880
And now we're going to do is set up our nav bar.

12:37.450 --> 12:38.810
So we'll come down here.

12:40.210 --> 12:43.000
And we're going to set up our nav bar.

12:43.220 --> 12:44.410
So there's our next.

12:44.420 --> 12:48.060
And let's set up the class calls and I would expect you to memorize these.

12:48.200 --> 12:51.290
I basically was just looking at the bootstrap documentation.

12:51.290 --> 12:55.640
In fact a lot of this was kind of just like copy and paste from Bootstrap documentation.

12:55.730 --> 13:01.710
So we use nav bar space nav bar dash default.

13:02.210 --> 13:07.400
And then I'm going to create another class called Tech fonts which is going to allow me if I go to blog

13:07.400 --> 13:18.030
about C Ss and that and now that's going to allow me to actually edit the fonts of the actual nav bar

13:18.060 --> 13:19.040
so that that.

13:19.470 --> 13:23.280
Going to say the font family of that is.

13:23.380 --> 13:26.990
Russo one that was the font from Google that we just got.

13:27.360 --> 13:30.470
And then it's also going to be sans serif.

13:30.640 --> 13:38.660
And then I'm also the font size to be I should say 1.5 E-M And then of course you have a lot of leeway.

13:38.660 --> 13:45.380
If however you want to do this and to give a little bit more margin here so I will save that.

13:45.480 --> 13:48.180
So coming back to base that is simple.

13:48.420 --> 13:49.980
So that's my tech funds.

13:50.010 --> 13:57.600
And then the other thing I want is custom nav bar so custom therefore is a class that I'm going to be

13:57.600 --> 14:01.310
using in case I ever want to customize anything else on my enough bar.

14:01.320 --> 14:03.620
I'll leave it blank for now on the blog about C Ss.

14:03.630 --> 14:06.120
I don't believe we actually ever really need it or use it.

14:06.120 --> 14:11.130
But sometimes a good idea to just add in another class while you're building at the base HTL template

14:11.250 --> 14:13.360
in case you ever want to mess around with it.

14:13.740 --> 14:19.650
So we'll save that and then we're gonna do have a div here and we're just going to give this a container

14:19.650 --> 14:24.310
div that way anything we put in the nav bar will actually be contained.

14:24.390 --> 14:27.350
So we're gonna have quite a few links here.

14:27.360 --> 14:33.910
First one is going to be effect let's give it a class Personal going to be our brand.

14:33.910 --> 14:40.540
So we'll call this nav bar dash brands and there's something else you can add in here we'll add another

14:40.540 --> 14:47.800
class big brand and that way we can link that to our CSSA file if necessary.

14:47.800 --> 14:50.210
And Big Brown is just something to make it a little bigger.

14:50.530 --> 15:00.970
So don't come over here and add an big brands class Elisha's have this be font size of 1.5 E-M.

15:01.000 --> 15:05.380
That way it looks a little larger than the rest of the text so if you notice back when we were running

15:05.380 --> 15:12.360
the blog project the brand font size of a little bit larger than the rest of it so that's what the big

15:12.360 --> 15:14.880
brand is for and then continuing on with this.

15:14.880 --> 15:16.260
What I want to do is set up the link.

15:16.260 --> 15:20.520
So if you go to the if you click on the brand I should take you back to the home page or remember the

15:20.520 --> 15:26.970
home page for us is the actual post lists also your all post list.

15:27.280 --> 15:31.760
And let's call this something like my blog OK.

15:32.000 --> 15:33.680
So I'm going to expand this.

15:33.680 --> 15:35.960
We don't really need to reference the browser anymore.

15:36.820 --> 15:39.480
And Addinall a little list item.

15:40.030 --> 15:44.080
And you can kind of fast forward for this if you don't want to watch me do all this just as a heads

15:44.080 --> 15:44.450
up.

15:47.390 --> 15:52.110
And then we went in about page either about yourself or the company.

15:52.150 --> 15:56.930
Now we'll just have to say about it can copy and paste all these links to make sure you get the spelling

15:56.930 --> 16:05.140
correct and then have two references so we'll have a reference outside reference that is to have dot

16:05.140 --> 16:10.320
com Maybe we're using this for your own portfolio site or your company's web page.

16:10.510 --> 16:11.640
We'll have something like that.

16:13.150 --> 16:17.220
And then let's have another one to link then

16:20.180 --> 16:25.150
and we'll have the say only then.

16:25.300 --> 16:29.590
And let's put this all in an unordered list.

16:30.400 --> 16:43.790
So on are list here and so be in their class loop's nav nav bar Sneath and all grab all these list items

16:43.790 --> 16:45.520
and put them into this an ordered list

16:49.460 --> 16:50.710
and I will save that.

16:50.880 --> 16:57.410
OK so now we have to make sure that if the user is logged into the Web site they see those other options

16:57.470 --> 17:02.870
and there's other options we're creating a new post drafts and then logging out and something that says

17:02.870 --> 17:06.560
something like welcome user welcome Jose cetera.

17:07.640 --> 17:14.570
So in order to do that I'm going to add in in other unordered list and I'm going to also give this class

17:15.470 --> 17:25.650
and will say nav bar actually nav nav bar dash nav nav bar dash right so everything's right aligned

17:25.980 --> 17:27.940
as far as the log in information.

17:28.050 --> 17:34.090
And here's we're going to add in some template tagging for some logic so we'll add an if statement and

17:34.090 --> 17:44.380
we'll say if the user is underscore authenticated which comes from our imports of the Auth. library

17:44.560 --> 17:51.520
in Jingo and whenever you have and if you always got to make sure you have an and if so have that as

17:51.520 --> 17:52.020
well.

17:53.220 --> 17:55.360
Now what kind of leave this towards the bottom.

17:56.250 --> 17:58.070
So if the user is authenticated what are we going to do.

17:58.080 --> 17:59.970
Well we should have a list item right.

18:00.180 --> 18:10.860
And that list item which is give it a anchor Ted and the anchor tag is going to be your template and

18:10.860 --> 18:19.060
the template is going to say oh blink to post-New and we'll have it say you post.

18:19.160 --> 18:23.610
So I'm going to copy and paste this because I want three more really similar things.

18:26.470 --> 18:30.040
I was sort of post-New to go to your draft page.

18:30.040 --> 18:35.590
So that is post draft list and associate new posts.

18:35.640 --> 18:41.990
We'll just have it say drafts to there's the unpublished blog post and then we also want some sort of

18:41.990 --> 18:45.100
log out button so I have log out.

18:45.560 --> 18:49.770
And then this will just say log out.

18:50.170 --> 18:58.300
And then finally after all that I want one more of these which is a little simpler that just says sexually.

18:58.310 --> 18:59.800
Sorry we're going to have a link.

18:59.820 --> 19:07.460
Just going to say Welcome saying welcome and we'll inject our name.

19:07.470 --> 19:13.390
So that's going to be user the user name save that.

19:13.460 --> 19:16.760
Now if you have an if statement you're probably going to have an else statement in order for this to

19:16.760 --> 19:18.110
all work correctly.

19:18.110 --> 19:21.330
So if we don't have any of that what is the right Bargen to look like.

19:21.640 --> 19:22.370
So we'll say

19:24.940 --> 19:35.800
else we'll have a list item or 10 give it's a link that says in which makes sense.

19:35.800 --> 19:42.910
So if you're not logged in you're going to want to log in and we'll say this template tag of your el

19:44.170 --> 19:48.130
log in and let's give this a class Alliance rights

19:51.220 --> 19:55.560
nav nav bar dash right.

19:55.650 --> 20:00.600
And if you can see here I believe it should fall under the unordered list class anyways but just because

20:00.600 --> 20:03.930
I'm a little paranoid add it to that particular item as well.

20:03.980 --> 20:11.240
And let's scroll over here and what we could do is just have something that says log in but instead

20:11.270 --> 20:15.400
we'll have a cliff icon which is essentially that little icon.

20:15.570 --> 20:17.750
And these are free icons that come with bootstrap.

20:17.930 --> 20:25.050
And in order to use them you just use the span and then give this band a class and the class name just

20:25.050 --> 20:28.550
matches up the actual icon you want to use.

20:28.550 --> 20:33.410
So in our case it's g l y glyph and then

20:36.060 --> 20:43.280
Sakal can dash user and that's a little kind of Facebook looking face that little profile.

20:43.540 --> 20:44.030
All right.

20:44.230 --> 20:49.470
So that should be it for our number so you can see here if we can review it.

20:49.720 --> 20:55.630
We have everything on the left hand side of my blog with the brand page about Herb Linked-In and then

20:55.630 --> 20:56.620
everything to the right.

20:56.670 --> 20:58.000
If the user is authenticated.

20:58.120 --> 21:01.330
We have these three links you post drafts log out.

21:01.510 --> 21:07.780
If they're not authenticated else or we're just going to have pay go to the logon page and it's a picture

21:07.780 --> 21:13.500
of someone it's not even some text now outside of the nav bar we're going to do is set up our actual

21:13.500 --> 21:14.590
content.

21:14.790 --> 21:15.720
So let's do that.

21:16.690 --> 21:23.730
Let's put all the content inside some sort of div and we can say have a class called content and then

21:23.730 --> 21:26.380
have another class called container in case we ever want to use it.

21:27.330 --> 21:32.230
And if we're interested in collapsing things like if it's on a mobile display this is where you could

21:32.320 --> 21:34.080
start adding and things like gross.

21:34.260 --> 21:39.300
So we don't really worry about this too much since we don't intend for people to really read or blog

21:39.300 --> 21:40.670
posts on immobile.

21:41.340 --> 21:47.250
But you would just have the Rosen here and then you can start saying well this class is going to be

21:47.250 --> 21:56.210
something like call medium A and then maybe have another class for the blog post that we can link it

21:56.210 --> 21:58.540
up to any CSSA that you want to affect.

21:58.580 --> 22:03.420
But eventually after you've done all your divs what you're going to want is the actual block itself.

22:04.580 --> 22:07.680
So it's going to be block and then contents

22:10.540 --> 22:12.340
or body block whatever you want to call it.

22:14.040 --> 22:16.080
And then we'll have an block here.

22:16.520 --> 22:16.910
OK.

22:17.100 --> 22:23.010
So basically you can add in a bunch of divs here that refer to the bootstrap ability to actually collapse

22:23.010 --> 22:27.940
things correctly according to whatever the grid system you worked out with.

22:28.410 --> 22:28.880
OK.

22:28.980 --> 22:31.700
So that is it for the base that each team M-file.

22:31.710 --> 22:36.520
It was a lot of typing but stuff like save us some time when we actually work with other templates.

22:36.720 --> 22:42.630
And that was hopefully a good enough explanation of where we got this medium style editor from as well

22:42.630 --> 22:49.200
as the Google fonts and as well as this custom CSSA if we go down here for the color changing and the

22:49.200 --> 22:53.730
key thing here to know is that we're going to be using this lower class at the very end to get everything

22:53.730 --> 22:54.510
done.

22:55.040 --> 22:55.830
OK.

22:55.920 --> 23:02.100
Make sure you copy and paste this from the notes if you're iffy on actually following along my coding

23:02.100 --> 23:03.010
here.

23:03.030 --> 23:07.500
Thanks and I will see at the next lecture where we begin to extend this to all the other templates.
