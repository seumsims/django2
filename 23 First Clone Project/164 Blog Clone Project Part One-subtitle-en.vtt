00:05.140 --> 00:09.060
Hello everyone and welcome to part one of the blog clone project.

00:09.340 --> 00:13.060
Now we're going to start off in this short lecture just setting up our jingle project.

00:13.060 --> 00:18.400
The application is going to be a single application project blog and then we'll also just do an initial

00:18.400 --> 00:20.080
run make sure everything's working.

00:20.140 --> 00:25.660
After that we'll set up a few files within our application a couple of your pie forms up-I those typical

00:25.660 --> 00:28.320
files that we're going to need for larger scale projects.

00:28.510 --> 00:33.590
OK let's shift to the editor and get started here and at the Adam text editor before we get started.

00:33.610 --> 00:36.660
Anything I want to make sure we set up some sort of virtual environment.

00:36.790 --> 00:41.440
This is optional if you don't have any plans on actually uploading this Web site to the Web and you're

00:41.440 --> 00:42.390
just working locally.

00:42.400 --> 00:45.130
But it is a good idea to have the virtual environment.

00:45.130 --> 00:49.130
I'm going to be activating the one we've always been using which is my jingo E.A..

00:49.300 --> 00:51.490
Feel free to create a new environment for each project.

00:51.490 --> 00:54.350
In fact that's what I would encourage you as a best practice.

00:54.510 --> 00:54.800
OK.

00:54.820 --> 00:58.450
So I can see what the prince sees my jingle envy is ready to go.

00:58.630 --> 01:04.300
So I'm going to CD into a folder that I just made called Blog project and you can actually see it up

01:04.300 --> 01:05.530
here and there jingle lectures.

01:05.530 --> 01:07.880
We have those other king levels in here.

01:07.990 --> 01:16.360
Jingo blog project and this we're all called Django dash admen say start project and then whatever you

01:16.360 --> 01:17.670
want to call the project.

01:17.710 --> 01:21.850
Don't call this project blog because that's actually going to be the name of our application within

01:21.850 --> 01:22.770
the project.

01:22.780 --> 01:28.130
So usually you want to call your project some sort of nickname that corresponds to the site itself.

01:28.150 --> 01:33.760
For instance if you were making an Instagram clone you would call your project insta or Instagram or

01:33.820 --> 01:38.770
Instagram project kind of thing you wouldn't want to call it something like pictures or messaging.

01:38.770 --> 01:44.500
So here we're going to do is just call it the most basic nickname can do which is my site so I'll say

01:44.500 --> 01:52.000
start project my site and then we're going to CD into my site and if I expand this over here on the

01:52.000 --> 01:57.400
left hand tab I should see my site and then my site number we get this kind of dual folders and we also

01:57.400 --> 02:04.300
have managed up-I so within my site I'm also going to start my application so we can call it Shingo

02:04.330 --> 02:09.700
that admen and you can actually do this with Python managed pi as well but I like doing it through jingo

02:09.700 --> 02:14.800
admen just to make sure I'm doing everything correctly and then the only application will have is the

02:14.800 --> 02:18.930
main blogging application that's going to be able to accept posts and comments for the blog.

02:19.060 --> 02:23.910
So we'll just call it blog and that's sort of the reason we don't want you to actually call the project

02:23.910 --> 02:26.850
itself blog because the main application is called Blog.

02:27.250 --> 02:27.770
OK.

02:28.570 --> 02:30.520
So here we have blog ready to go.

02:30.550 --> 02:34.390
I'm going to expand blog and there's a couple of more files that I want in here.

02:34.390 --> 02:38.250
I want a URLs that PI file because eventually I'm going to need that.

02:38.290 --> 02:45.480
So say a new file within blog called you URLs not pi and then I also plan to create some forms.

02:45.490 --> 02:51.330
So again inside a blog all say new file and call it forms thought pi.

02:51.460 --> 02:52.750
OK that's really all we need for now.

02:52.750 --> 02:57.790
Later on we'll add some template folders etc. but whenever you add in a new application you always want

02:57.790 --> 03:01.000
to make sure that you come to settings that apply come down.

03:01.030 --> 03:06.370
Scroll down to where it says install apps and make sure that the application that you just created is

03:06.370 --> 03:07.120
there.

03:07.850 --> 03:12.330
And if you ever get some errors with this whenever you're running your server make sure that your format

03:12.330 --> 03:17.850
is the same as mine to notice here that I have logged project my site and then under my site I have

03:17.850 --> 03:18.900
two folders.

03:18.900 --> 03:23.280
The blog all the applications the project folder and then you're managed up high.

03:23.340 --> 03:28.050
Sometimes a little confusing that you have two folders a set the rectory at the exact same name as its

03:28.050 --> 03:29.160
parent there victory.

03:29.160 --> 03:32.910
That's basically how Django does this automatically so just keep an eye out for that.

03:32.910 --> 03:35.390
Make sure you're in the right my site folder.

03:35.890 --> 03:40.620
OK once you've done that let's do it we should always do which is called Peifer managed up-I and migrate

03:40.650 --> 03:41.720
everything.

03:41.760 --> 03:46.500
So say Python managed up-I migrate.

03:46.920 --> 03:49.720
Enter is going to run all those migrations.

03:49.890 --> 03:51.740
Looks like everything's working well.

03:51.780 --> 03:54.390
And then we also want to set up perhaps location.

03:54.390 --> 04:00.530
So I'll say Python make migrations and then call the application we want which is blog.

04:00.590 --> 04:11.860
Whoops I need to say Python mintage stop py make migrations and then called blog OK no changes to an

04:11.860 --> 04:12.600
app blog.

04:12.640 --> 04:15.440
As expected I don't actually have any new models there.

04:15.520 --> 04:19.960
We'll take care of that later on because here we have a empty models but it's always a good idea to

04:19.960 --> 04:23.300
do that and you probably heard me say this a million times by now.

04:23.590 --> 04:28.970
I always like to just run migrate one more time just to check that it says no change is detected.

04:29.140 --> 04:30.670
And it says no migration to apply.

04:30.670 --> 04:31.310
Perfect.

04:31.330 --> 04:33.420
So let's make sure this actually all works out.

04:33.760 --> 04:40.880
I'll call Python managed to apply and run the server OK looks like we have no errors there.

04:40.880 --> 04:46.420
I'm going to copy this and bring over my browser and then bring in over my browser page.

04:46.430 --> 04:46.940
Here it is.

04:46.940 --> 04:47.330
It worked.

04:47.330 --> 04:49.740
Congratulations on your first Django power page.

04:49.880 --> 04:55.340
That's exactly what we want and hopefully by now this whole process of setting up your projects the

04:55.340 --> 05:00.800
applications a couple of files are going to need do the migrations and running the actual server.

05:00.850 --> 05:02.780
They should all be really familiar to you.

05:02.810 --> 05:07.460
And honestly by now you probably have these steps memorized if you don't I would encourage you to run

05:07.460 --> 05:10.970
through his homework time on your own completely until you have the steps memorized because this is

05:10.970 --> 05:15.100
what you're going to be doing basically every time you start a python Django project.

05:15.350 --> 05:16.370
That's it for this lecture.

05:16.370 --> 05:20.390
Pretty short on just getting everything set up in the next couple of lectures will start actually filling

05:20.390 --> 05:21.820
out some of these files.

05:21.860 --> 05:23.390
So everyone I'll see at the next lecture.
