Hello everyone and welcome to this quick advance side lecture where we talk about the Gengel de-bug

00:10.290 --> 00:12.440
toolbar.

00:12.530 --> 00:17.150
We've already seen how to manually debug Django at the end of our clone projects but maybe there's a

00:17.150 --> 00:22.100
better way that we can try to get a little more help and luckily there is it's called the Django de-bug

00:22.110 --> 00:28.490
toolbar and it's a favorite tool for jangles developers to help them try to catch where errors are happening

00:28.520 --> 00:30.070
inside of their project.

00:31.000 --> 00:36.310
The jingle toolbar gives useful panel tools about your project that can help you clarify why certain

00:36.310 --> 00:38.610
behavior is occurring or happening.

00:38.710 --> 00:43.960
It won't be able to pinpoint the exact source of a bug or help you figure out how to actually change

00:43.960 --> 00:44.840
the syntax.

00:44.980 --> 00:49.600
It really just contains useful information that you may find helpful to actually find and help fix the

00:49.600 --> 00:51.230
bugs.

00:51.560 --> 00:56.280
So this with the toolbar actually looks like we'll actually play around for a lot more in the next lecture.

00:56.330 --> 01:01.430
But essentially you see on the right hand side this toolbar and there's various panels they can click

01:01.430 --> 01:05.770
on and then it gives you information about your website.

01:05.770 --> 01:10.570
Now keep in mind this may or may not fit with your workflow style but it is helpful enough that many

01:10.570 --> 01:16.060
developers that work of Django keep it up to date of their open source contributions so it may not work

01:16.060 --> 01:21.580
for you but it's a very popular tool for developers in general which is why it's worth talking about

01:22.390 --> 01:25.680
in order to get the debug toolbar in your virtual environment.

01:25.720 --> 01:31.090
Go to your command line and type Pipp install Shingo dasht debug cache toolbar and depending on how

01:31.090 --> 01:36.190
you actually install Django and your version you may even already have installed but again go to a virtual

01:36.190 --> 01:41.220
environment and do that Pipp install command OK in the next lecture.

01:41.220 --> 01:45.120
What we're going to do is briefly go over the panels and what information they show you.

01:45.240 --> 01:48.110
Then you can decide if it's a good fit for your workflow.

01:48.120 --> 01:54.030
A lot of the projects in this course are small enough where the toolbar may not be a deciding factor

01:54.030 --> 01:59.010
in whether or not use it though once you become a developer either as part of a larger company or you

01:59.010 --> 02:01.510
start develop your own really large projects.

02:01.530 --> 02:04.550
The toolbar may be a good choice for your workflow.

02:04.590 --> 02:06.390
OK I'll see you at the next lecture.
