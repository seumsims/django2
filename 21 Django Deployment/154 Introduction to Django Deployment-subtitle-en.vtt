Hello everyone and welcome to jingle deployment.

00:08.760 --> 00:11.040
So welcome to the deployment section.

00:11.040 --> 00:14.760
Before we continue I really want to tell you that there's still so many topics to learn though we're

00:14.760 --> 00:15.990
going to cover in this course.

00:16.110 --> 00:21.450
Things like Oren's advanced user authorization social logons that means logging into the site with like

00:21.450 --> 00:24.050
Facebook or get payments rest.

00:24.070 --> 00:29.200
They provide encryption testing sessions cookies class based views and so much more.

00:29.280 --> 00:31.840
So don't worry we're still going to tackle a lot of these topics.

00:31.920 --> 00:38.250
But for right now we're going to cover those topics in a mix of clone projects and advanced Gengel topics

00:38.490 --> 00:39.870
in future sections.

00:39.870 --> 00:45.210
I think by now you've learned enough that if you really want to go out in your own reference online

00:45.210 --> 00:49.740
sources and documentation to build whatever web application that you had in mind.

00:49.740 --> 00:53.880
So for now we're going to mark a milestone in our knowledge by learning how to actually deploy our Gengel

00:53.880 --> 00:59.610
projects before we continue I want to quickly discuss deployment options in general.

00:59.610 --> 01:04.200
There are many many options for the point your site that each option is going to come with a tradeoff

01:04.500 --> 01:09.370
on things like price scalability security ease of use etc..

01:09.680 --> 01:14.810
Please check the resource links in this lecture for instructions on how to play Django to a wide variety

01:14.810 --> 01:15.800
of platforms.

01:15.800 --> 01:20.510
What I've done is I've google search and found the best step by step guides for a wide variety of Gengel

01:20.510 --> 01:21.160
platforms.

01:21.160 --> 01:28.520
Things like elastic beanstalk Heroku Python anywhere except her and each guide is a clear step by step

01:28.520 --> 01:31.540
walkthrough of deploying on a platform.

01:31.570 --> 01:35.870
So for this lecture we're going to show you how to use the deploy functionality for a very simple and

01:35.870 --> 01:36.140
easy.

01:36.140 --> 01:39.360
He is host called Python and the word dot com.

01:39.380 --> 01:41.820
Later on we can talk about things like the plumbing to a veeps.

01:41.890 --> 01:45.110
It's like Digital Ocean or hosting service like Heroku.

01:45.170 --> 01:49.610
And definitely check out the resource links for fools step by step guides on how to do those sort of

01:49.610 --> 01:51.030
deployments.

01:51.710 --> 01:55.880
Understanding the basic process on a simple site like Python anywhere that com will really help you

01:55.880 --> 02:02.030
when it comes to playing on more technical platforms like elastic being stuck on a W-S and as you continue

02:02.030 --> 02:06.050
on through the course and your interest in deploying to particular platform or service usually just

02:06.050 --> 02:10.040
a simple Google search of the service name plus jingle results in many guides.

02:10.820 --> 02:15.030
It is in the best interest of these services that a well-written deployment guide is available.

02:15.050 --> 02:19.760
Otherwise they won't make any money because if users find it hard to deploy on their Web site or service

02:20.000 --> 02:20.920
they're just not going to use it.

02:20.960 --> 02:26.930
So at this point in time basically every major hosting service that's a good fit for Django has a really

02:26.930 --> 02:27.930
well-written guide.

02:27.980 --> 02:31.530
So again check the resource links I've linked some of the best ones here.

02:31.700 --> 02:34.820
And keep that in mind as you explore a wide range of options.

02:34.820 --> 02:39.350
I understand that Python and where that com isn't going to work for everybody on their applications

02:39.350 --> 02:44.390
or for their startup etc. So this is more of a general guide on how to deploy something whether you

02:44.390 --> 02:49.480
actually end up using Python anywhere that com for your own web projects is really up to you.

02:50.730 --> 02:51.230
All right.

02:51.330 --> 02:53.290
So it's time to show the world what we've created.

02:53.310 --> 02:55.340
We're going to get started with the plan that Gengel project.

02:55.350 --> 03:00.450
But first we'll need to learn how to use get hub to host our code and go through a deployment checklist.

03:00.450 --> 03:02.310
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.

03:02.310 --> 03:04.530
We're going to be covering hub either.
