00:05.020 --> 00:06.280
Hello everyone.

00:06.280 --> 00:11.950
Before we actually begin work in Python anywhere it's the pleasure site to talk about it and a version

00:11.950 --> 00:17.660
control when we think about deploying our project will probably be useful to have all our code posted

00:17.660 --> 00:19.010
somewhere online.

00:19.040 --> 00:24.300
This way we can easily call it from the virtual server hosting service we are using.

00:24.310 --> 00:30.160
So before we actually do that let's talk about what is gets in what gets hub a really common misconception

00:30.160 --> 00:33.320
for beginners is that get and get a hub or the same thing.

00:33.430 --> 00:40.500
They are NOT get is a version control system that helps keep track of changes in your code gets hub

00:40.770 --> 00:47.520
is a company and the Web site helps manage it and host your files on their site gets is an open source

00:47.520 --> 00:54.000
totally free version control system gets hub is a company that utilizes that and adds extra tools on

00:54.000 --> 00:58.380
top of that and host your files your code on their site.

00:58.380 --> 01:01.130
They offer extra tools for collaboration and things of that manner.

01:01.970 --> 01:08.180
So the main idea for us is that you can have one repository with various historic checkpoints that you

01:08.180 --> 01:13.250
can always refer back to it with a history of any changes and that is what is known as a version control

01:13.560 --> 01:20.230
a different control over all the various versions of the particular file you had is one of the most

01:20.230 --> 01:25.810
popular code hosting sites on the web and it allows you to easily get a version control and keep copies

01:25.810 --> 01:27.110
of the code on the web.

01:28.000 --> 01:32.480
And the first step is free to go to get home and create a free account then will download get to our

01:32.480 --> 01:35.610
computer and upload our project repository to get help.

01:35.780 --> 01:40.760
If you're already a student that knows how to get Herb and create an upload to a repository just upload

01:40.760 --> 01:45.230
your project folder to the people you make and skips to the next lecture for everyone else it's good

01:45.230 --> 01:49.440
to get help dotcom explore how to use it and get everything set up online.

01:49.590 --> 01:51.070
You at hub dot com.

01:51.470 --> 01:56.770
OK so here I am at get hub basically offers two levels of service.

01:56.780 --> 02:03.260
One is free and the free level of service basically works almost exactly the same as the paid version

02:03.560 --> 02:06.800
except for the paid version you get to keep your files private.

02:06.800 --> 02:10.530
If you're not paying and it's free then you have to publicly host everything.

02:10.550 --> 02:12.230
So anyone can see your code.

02:12.290 --> 02:16.880
Obviously if you're a corporation or a company or you want to keep your code hidden from other people

02:16.880 --> 02:21.790
because it has proprietary knowledge you would have to pay get hub to host your stuff on there.

02:21.800 --> 02:24.650
Right now we'll just focus on the free get held account.

02:24.860 --> 02:30.350
So were you going to do is if you don't have one yet click sign up and then sign up for a hub you'll

02:30.350 --> 02:36.530
set up a personal account username email address password choose your plan will be a free plan and then

02:36.530 --> 02:37.540
step 3.

02:37.610 --> 02:40.310
Some tailor your experience stuff so don't worry about that.

02:40.790 --> 02:43.970
All right so once you sign up then go ahead and sign in.

02:43.970 --> 02:45.170
I'm going to sign in right now.

02:46.540 --> 02:51.140
And you'll get something that looks similar to this you probably won't have everything that I have here.

02:51.190 --> 02:55.750
You can see that with dot com you can collaborate if other people show their changes.

02:55.750 --> 03:01.540
So for example here's a constructor of mine and there's his account and he's working on a project with

03:01.540 --> 03:02.200
me.

03:02.200 --> 03:07.120
So if I click on this I'll take me to the project we're working on and I can actually view the changes.

03:07.120 --> 03:12.280
So in green is what is currently there and in red is what was removed or deleted.

03:12.280 --> 03:14.800
So that's basically the way we can collaborate people and get a job.

03:14.980 --> 03:20.710
And it's also really nice because pretty much every major open source project is now being hosted on

03:20.860 --> 03:26.020
Hub's if you ever want to contribute to Django or any other open source project you can do it with your

03:26.020 --> 03:26.800
account.

03:26.860 --> 03:29.710
But we're going to be doing is setting up a repository.

03:30.010 --> 03:36.280
So we will click right here on your repository and you'll give this a repository name so something short

03:36.370 --> 03:37.550
and memorable.

03:37.840 --> 03:50.950
So we will call this jingo cash deployments bash example you can give a description so we'll say repo

03:50.970 --> 04:00.930
for our jingo deployments example and then I can set this private or public because I actually pay for

04:00.930 --> 04:01.920
an account here.

04:02.250 --> 04:06.570
Obviously I'll set it public because that's what you're going to be doing and whether or not you want

04:06.570 --> 04:08.280
to initialize it Fareed me is up to you.

04:08.280 --> 04:09.920
We don't need one so we won't do it.

04:10.260 --> 04:16.810
And then we can also say add ignore which is files that you want to ignore and it's version control.

04:16.830 --> 04:18.350
We also don't really need to worry about that.

04:18.380 --> 04:20.190
So let's just create the repository for now.

04:23.810 --> 04:25.750
So then we have the quick set up.

04:25.760 --> 04:30.410
So if you've done this kind of thing before which I assume you haven't there's a quick way to set up

04:30.410 --> 04:34.520
this repository onto your desktop.

04:34.540 --> 04:39.460
Now there are many ways to do this but we're going to be focusing on using the command line to do this

04:39.460 --> 04:42.470
so we can interact with this in the Adam text editor.

04:42.490 --> 04:47.410
There's a lot of other ways including a full desktop application that comes with get how free.

04:47.620 --> 04:54.670
Or they can use actually visualizes process or you can just quickly S-sh or use HTP here.

04:54.670 --> 05:01.240
Well we're going to do is use the command line at our terminal or a command prompt but in order to do

05:01.240 --> 05:03.710
that we actually need to download it itself.

05:03.940 --> 05:06.170
So far we've only set up our account on hub.

05:06.310 --> 05:08.370
We actually download get to our computer.

05:08.380 --> 05:13.740
So the way we do that is you come to this Web site and this is if you just google search gets there

05:13.780 --> 05:15.730
should be one of the first things that comes up.

05:16.070 --> 05:19.200
It gets as CNN.com.

05:19.220 --> 05:26.910
That's I-T bash as CNN.com and this is where it gets the free and open source version control system.

05:27.040 --> 05:28.890
It's hosted so you can download it.

05:28.990 --> 05:33.730
You're going to do is depending whether you're on Windows or Mac etc. you're going to download it.

05:33.730 --> 05:38.380
So if you're on a Mac it means you may already have it on your computer so make sure to check for that.

05:38.410 --> 05:41.820
The way to check is if you go to your command prompt.

05:42.160 --> 05:48.280
So for instance here I just popped up my command prompt or if you're on your Mac your terminal or terminal

05:48.280 --> 05:50.770
for Linux is well to check if you already have it.

05:50.770 --> 05:55.150
Go get dash dash version enter.

05:55.210 --> 06:00.580
And if you get something out that means you actually already have get installed and you don't need to

06:00.580 --> 06:05.380
worry about this doesn't really matter what version really any version should work that's been downloaded

06:05.380 --> 06:07.860
in the past Um no three years.

06:07.990 --> 06:10.780
But let me walk through the actual download process for you.

06:10.840 --> 06:16.500
Especially if you're on a Windows computer that can be a little confusing maybe but if you're a beginner

06:16.510 --> 06:21.100
so going to click download for Windows says Downloading starting and then it's going to download that

06:21.100 --> 06:21.990
for me.

06:22.030 --> 06:26.250
So it's about 30 megabytes going forward in time for this download to finish.

06:27.650 --> 06:33.710
And then once you've downloaded either the DNG or an executable whatever for your format go ahead and

06:33.710 --> 06:34.440
click on it.

06:34.640 --> 06:37.420
Make sure you downloaded the correct 32 or 64 bit

06:40.230 --> 06:41.920
allow it to make changes on your computer.

06:41.920 --> 06:48.060
Sorry if I went black there for a second and then we're going to do is say next except that license.

06:48.070 --> 06:54.320
Go ahead and save it to get and then you can add some additional stuff to this.

06:54.480 --> 06:58.860
And I would just accept all default options so just keep everything default.

06:59.160 --> 07:02.370
Click next and then click Next again.

07:02.960 --> 07:08.540
And here's where we have three options especially if you're on Windows the one you need to make sure

07:08.900 --> 07:11.390
is that it actually adds to the path.

07:11.450 --> 07:16.090
So this one right here it says Use get from the windows command prompt says adding it to your path.

07:16.100 --> 07:17.090
That's exactly what you need.

07:17.090 --> 07:20.740
Because if it's not added to your path you won't be able to call it from the command line.

07:20.900 --> 07:23.030
So then you can click next.

07:23.060 --> 07:28.050
Then there's the check out either Windows style as is or other Cheka options.

07:28.280 --> 07:32.870
You may not see this tab if you're on a Mac or Linux so don't worry about it but we'll just select the

07:32.870 --> 07:35.540
default again next.

07:35.550 --> 07:40.120
Again you can hit any of these that we'll continue.

07:41.760 --> 07:47.210
And then we can just again go to defaults and then you can hit install.

07:47.240 --> 07:51.250
So once you hit we'll begin installing it onto your computer.

07:53.410 --> 07:57.500
So I'm going to forward in time until the installation is finished.

07:58.440 --> 08:02.790
So once this is done we can just say don't worry about doing the release notes for a launch you get

08:02.790 --> 08:07.890
bashed to it finished and then go back to your command prompt either in Adam or by itself where you're

08:07.890 --> 08:08.940
terminal.

08:08.940 --> 08:13.030
So once you've completed that installation and have finished you can go back to your command prompt

08:13.040 --> 08:14.210
or your terminal.

08:14.220 --> 08:17.850
Sometimes you have to restart your computer in order for this to take effect.

08:17.900 --> 08:24.330
They should be able to now type gets dash dash version version enter and see the same version of whatever

08:24.330 --> 08:25.440
you just downloaded.

08:25.440 --> 08:28.790
In my case it was version 2.1 2.0.

08:28.800 --> 08:35.160
Again if you're seeing something that says get not recognized as a command try restarting your computer

08:35.280 --> 08:38.320
and then entering this again if you're still having issues.

08:38.430 --> 08:44.640
Go ahead and post the Q&amp;A forums but definitely search the Q&amp;A forums for any specific questions that

08:44.640 --> 08:45.490
you may have.

08:45.690 --> 08:51.080
It's most likely the questions already been answered about this.

08:51.220 --> 08:55.980
All right now that I'm here at Adam one and going to do is inside Gengel lectures or wherever you so

08:55.980 --> 08:56.820
choose.

08:56.820 --> 09:02.460
I'm going to add a new folder and this will be the folder that's going to contain a subdirectory of

09:02.460 --> 09:04.500
our actual get repository.

09:04.500 --> 09:12.530
So you can call this folder whatever you want I'll call it my underscore base.

09:12.580 --> 09:14.200
It really doesn't matter what you call it.

09:14.200 --> 09:20.290
But then where you're going to do is CD into my underscore base and this is where we're actually going

09:20.290 --> 09:26.740
to initialize our get repository and all the commands we're going to be running our right here on this

09:26.830 --> 09:29.010
create a new repository on the command line.

09:29.050 --> 09:32.470
You don't actually need to worry about this first command that's just going to create a read me for

09:32.470 --> 09:33.040
you.

09:33.070 --> 09:37.200
We don't really care about that so it will do instead is an going to collapses.

09:37.210 --> 09:40.010
We see a little more room start with this.

09:40.160 --> 09:42.920
And it's so we'll say get in it.

09:44.570 --> 09:48.580
G I t in its enter.

09:48.870 --> 09:53.060
And this is going to initialize an empty get repository right at my base.

09:53.130 --> 09:57.310
And then what I'm going to do is you don't actually need to do the add.

09:57.350 --> 10:01.390
And so what we'll do is copy and paste one of our projects here.

10:01.800 --> 10:06.910
So open up the directory tree and that any of the projects we've been working on is totally fine.

10:07.110 --> 10:10.720
I will copy the learning templates project from Gengel level floor.

10:10.740 --> 10:12.570
Again you can do anything.

10:12.570 --> 10:19.260
So we will copy this and then anoint to put it into my base so we'll say paste.

10:19.260 --> 10:23.560
So now I have learning templates and then when I'm going to do is do get at it.

10:23.570 --> 10:32.520
And instead of the read me the M.D. That's related to this ongoing same gets added and then just a period.

10:32.520 --> 10:35.500
And that basically means add everything.

10:35.700 --> 10:36.080
Right.

10:36.090 --> 10:44.830
So now we have some couple of warnings here about wine and things things like that pie files.

10:45.050 --> 10:47.730
For now you don't need to worry about these line endings.

10:47.780 --> 10:49.190
That's totally fine.

10:49.220 --> 10:51.870
So if you get a bunch of warnings like that that's totally OK.

10:53.130 --> 10:56.920
All right so now that we've added everything we're going to need to commit everything.

10:56.950 --> 11:01.150
And the way you can do a commit it's also shown right here on this get commit.

11:01.260 --> 11:03.830
First commit you could you could just copy and paste that line.

11:04.050 --> 11:09.670
But all right it out and say gets the minutes and I will say dots.

11:09.750 --> 11:16.030
Everything that we just added say dash am and then a single quote.

11:16.380 --> 11:18.100
First single quote.

11:18.390 --> 11:23.340
Basically this message right here of first can be interchange for any message that you will want to

11:23.340 --> 11:25.750
see on it so you can say something like oh.

11:25.800 --> 11:31.450
Added learning templates project or fixed issue on this file or whatever.

11:31.530 --> 11:35.030
As long as it's just in quotes as a string that's going to be the commit message.

11:35.250 --> 11:40.840
So will enter and now it's going to be committed and you should see something like it's creating a bunch

11:40.840 --> 11:41.390
of modes.

11:41.470 --> 11:48.940
That's exactly what you want and then the next thing is to say this line get remote at origin and then

11:49.000 --> 11:55.540
the actual Your L Sugoi to this when I am going to just directly copy and paste it going to copy this

11:55.750 --> 12:00.340
and then right click here paste it and then hit Enter.

12:00.340 --> 12:01.480
That's all I need to do.

12:01.570 --> 12:06.880
And then what next line is is the string here get push that you orig. master.

12:06.880 --> 12:13.370
So copy that paste it and you can always pause the video in case you need time to write these lines

12:13.370 --> 12:15.140
then enter.

12:15.170 --> 12:18.750
This should push all the changes that we just made to get a hub.

12:18.770 --> 12:19.850
This might take a little while.

12:19.860 --> 12:25.170
The pending on your internet connection and you may also be prompted to log in so you see here.

12:25.220 --> 12:26.610
I was prompted to log in.

12:26.660 --> 12:32.310
You may be prompted to log in at your actual terminal reata provide your email and password.

12:32.330 --> 12:38.610
I have a Windows desktop server so I can just log in here I'm going to do that now.

12:38.810 --> 12:41.860
So I just logged in and now it's going to do it for me.

12:41.870 --> 12:45.030
Most likely you'll be asked to log in at the actual command prompt.

12:45.050 --> 12:51.260
If you don't have those settings like I do but everything should have been pushed to see it's writing

12:51.290 --> 12:55.870
the objects and sending them on line so everything should have been pushed to the actual repository.

12:55.910 --> 12:57.390
So let's come back here.

12:57.680 --> 13:04.220
We can expand this window and then click on whatever happens to call your an example here.

13:04.250 --> 13:08.040
Now I see learning templates and it was pushed by Portsea.

13:08.240 --> 13:11.860
Right now that's actually my personal Gebe account.

13:11.930 --> 13:14.600
That's my dog Frankie sleeping there.

13:14.930 --> 13:20.910
But anyways you should be able to see the files and that's all we need to do for now.

13:21.020 --> 13:23.320
So it looks like there's a commit message first.

13:23.330 --> 13:24.940
Again you could call that whatever you want.

13:25.010 --> 13:27.720
Well I can see the delays commit it was 2 minutes ago.

13:27.830 --> 13:28.430
Perfect.

13:28.490 --> 13:32.190
That's all we need to do and we are ready to go.

13:32.360 --> 13:35.930
If you have any questions on any of these steps feel free to post the Kewney forums.

13:35.930 --> 13:40.480
Make sure to search the Kewney forums to see if your question has been answered.

13:40.520 --> 13:45.730
This is a really common place where XLE mistyping a character not following the instructions exactly.

13:45.920 --> 13:49.510
Or maybe just getting lucky if the install can cause hiccups.

13:49.520 --> 13:50.210
Don't worry about it.

13:50.240 --> 13:54.800
I'm always here to help out but make sure you search first because your old question has probably already

13:54.800 --> 13:55.830
been asked before.

13:55.850 --> 13:58.070
All right thanks everybody and I'll see you at the next lecture.
