Hello everyone and welcome to the template inheritance code examples lecture.

00:09.040 --> 00:13.710
We're going to be cutting through the topics we just previously discussed for a inheritance.

00:13.720 --> 00:16.000
Let's hop over to the editor and get started.

00:16.390 --> 00:22.510
All right so here I am using the learning underscore templates project we created in the previous coding

00:22.510 --> 00:24.280
lecture for the section of the course.

00:24.280 --> 00:27.100
Remember that we created this base team File.

00:27.280 --> 00:32.610
Let's show you how you can create some typical looking based thrist him code and then use it and extend

00:32.610 --> 00:38.530
it to the other HDMI files we have in this application such as this index file other HCM L and then

00:38.530 --> 00:40.630
even the relative u r l template.

00:41.150 --> 00:51.640
OK so in 0 all team files you always want to have this line of code be first and it's dot type T.M..

00:51.810 --> 00:54.100
So that always needs to come first.

00:54.100 --> 00:59.000
In an time I'll file and you can get it easily just by typing HTL and hitting enter.

00:59.040 --> 01:02.930
That will always be the first line no matter what kind of template tags are using.

01:02.930 --> 01:05.220
Again this should always be on line number one.

01:05.220 --> 01:05.950
OK.

01:05.970 --> 01:11.040
So let's make sure that we have bootstrap linked across our entire web site.

01:11.250 --> 01:15.960
The way to do this easily is instead of having that link and every single that a steam file we just

01:15.960 --> 01:17.800
put it in the base that each time l file.

01:17.940 --> 01:19.650
I want to copy and paste this.

01:19.770 --> 01:23.230
Either you can do either from the notes or from Bootstrap dot com.

01:23.550 --> 01:23.890
OK.

01:23.910 --> 01:26.530
So there's going to bootstrap there's my drift to it.

01:26.730 --> 01:30.950
And again this could also be a link to a local file underneath templates.

01:31.020 --> 01:34.480
You could have CSSA and then link it to bootstrap locally.

01:34.650 --> 01:37.670
Truly up to you whether you want to link it online or link it locally.

01:37.750 --> 01:42.600
It's a little faster if you link it locally specially when you begin to deploy your projects.

01:42.770 --> 01:48.630
Plus you can always make sure that you're not dependent on someone else hosting this all right now inside

01:48.630 --> 01:53.960
this body let's create a navigation bar so we do this by calling it now.

01:54.180 --> 01:58.380
And I'm going to pass in the classes and I don't have these memorized.

01:58.380 --> 02:03.580
I'm just copying and pasting these from the notes and also from the bootstrap bootstrap documentation.

02:03.600 --> 02:08.850
So I would not expect you to just knowingly know all the classes like I'm typing them here so feel free

02:08.850 --> 02:13.800
to just copy and paste from the notes or type along with me but the class from the nav bar that I'm

02:13.800 --> 02:24.660
using is nav bar space nav bar defaults and then nav bar static top and then I going to put this that

02:24.660 --> 02:30.290
comes next inside of a container class and then will have an unordered list.

02:30.290 --> 02:32.970
And this is the stuff that's actually inside that nav bar.

02:33.050 --> 02:44.080
So I will give this unordered list a class of NAV space nav bar nav and then inside the sort of list

02:44.110 --> 02:49.240
I go to have list items will be anchor tags and they're going to link to different parts of that page.

02:49.260 --> 02:53.380
But these are going to have a class of.

02:53.660 --> 02:59.630
And this first one is going to be the actual brand page so nav bar dash brands and pretty much just

02:59.680 --> 03:01.880
always takes you back to the home page.

03:01.990 --> 03:04.880
So we won't mess around with the references right now.

03:04.930 --> 03:10.580
We'll set up the template inheritance first and then we'll come back and review how to do template or

03:10.600 --> 03:12.500
else with these rough tags.

03:12.610 --> 03:21.400
But inside of this anger attack I'm just going to say brand save that and then create an other list

03:21.610 --> 03:22.460
item.

03:22.720 --> 03:23.890
In other a..

03:23.980 --> 03:24.940
And this.

03:24.950 --> 03:29.820
And let's actually instead of putting this class in the list item let's put it inside the anchor type.

03:29.920 --> 03:31.620
So a little cleaner.

03:31.730 --> 03:33.330
There we go.

03:33.410 --> 03:39.050
And then this anchor tag is also going to have a class and this class is going to be equal to a nav

03:39.050 --> 03:49.830
bar dash link class and we'll have this link to the admin page and let's copy and paste this create

03:49.830 --> 03:55.770
one more you know what we're gonna do here is have this link to the other page number we have that other

03:55.770 --> 03:57.840
that it's female file.

03:57.870 --> 04:03.360
Ok so that all goes inside this container div and all of that is going inside this nav bar.

04:04.960 --> 04:07.260
Perfect.

04:07.280 --> 04:12.110
And then since we're using bootstrap it would be nice is making sure anything else I put in the body

04:12.140 --> 04:14.970
is already inside a container so I don't need to call that.

04:15.020 --> 04:19.740
So what I'm going to do is create a DIV tag that says container.

04:19.930 --> 04:23.470
And again all this sort of styling and class thing that's really going to be up to you when you're creating

04:23.470 --> 04:25.220
your own project what you think looks good.

04:25.230 --> 04:29.070
You tested on mobile devices on tablets see what else looks good etc..

04:29.080 --> 04:35.050
So definitely don't take this as absolutely 100 percent must do really all of this stuff at a certain

04:35.050 --> 04:39.250
point becomes your own personal choice and personal styling depending on what your Web site is going

04:39.250 --> 04:41.480
to be used for.

04:41.830 --> 04:47.380
So right now I have everything that I want to display across every single page and every single page

04:47.380 --> 04:53.230
on my web site had this nav bar and have its body contained in a container and have the link to bootstrap

04:53.980 --> 04:59.370
which means I need to set up my actual template tags that will define this.

04:59.550 --> 05:14.120
So we'll call this block body underscore block and then we'll write a comment here anything outside

05:14.120 --> 05:20.500
of this will be inherit inherited if you extend.

05:20.540 --> 05:24.290
Typically you will have this comment but just typing in there you can get an idea.

05:24.500 --> 05:30.550
And then finally want to end the block so we use and block for this.

05:30.550 --> 05:35.920
And if we install some Django plugins for Adam text editor a lot of the stuff is syntax highlighted

05:35.920 --> 05:38.140
and done automatically for you.

05:38.200 --> 05:46.270
OK so basically we're seeing here is everything outside of this is going to be inherited when we call

05:46.270 --> 05:47.020
extend on it.

05:47.020 --> 05:48.650
So let's actually practice that.

05:48.670 --> 05:53.400
So I will come to my other large team M-file and this is where it gets really cool.

05:54.470 --> 05:59.450
Right now I have a bunch of stuff in this age Tim L file but really the only thing that's unique here

05:59.450 --> 06:01.410
is the fact that it says welcome to other.

06:01.610 --> 06:07.850
So all I need to do is make sure that the doctype HVM code is there I can delete everything else and

06:07.850 --> 06:14.380
then just extend my template so it will say appear on the second line.

06:15.560 --> 06:21.860
Extends and then pass in the file path to that template which is under templates.

06:22.010 --> 06:27.500
And then I call basic app slash based dot HTL.

06:27.700 --> 06:33.560
And so you know now that I could have various template files as my base template even across different

06:33.560 --> 06:38.420
applications across the template folder and I just need to make sure that I call the right one and extend

06:38.420 --> 06:41.970
the right one that we are not just limited to the one based on each team.

06:42.530 --> 06:51.480
OK so once we've done the extension there what I do is call this tag a call block

06:54.900 --> 07:02.740
body block and this matches basically what I had and based on each T.M. that's this guy.

07:02.840 --> 07:07.500
But now instead of everything being outside everything's going to be inside.

07:07.550 --> 07:09.550
So that says welcome to other.

07:09.560 --> 07:19.240
And then let's say this is an example of template inheritance inheritance and then finally I'm going

07:19.240 --> 07:22.590
to close this off with an end block.

07:24.750 --> 07:25.350
And that's it.

07:25.350 --> 07:28.110
Now this other than a stem cell file is ready to go.

07:28.110 --> 07:34.310
Key things to note here is doc type always line number one then call the extends on whatever base that

07:34.310 --> 07:40.440
each team M-file looking for then a call block the body block and then whatever content you want there

07:40.680 --> 07:41.970
and then you can end the block.

07:41.970 --> 07:43.070
And that's basically it.

07:43.110 --> 07:44.390
You can actually see that.

07:44.430 --> 07:48.670
Now the template tags when they were confusing at first we were first to learn jingo.

07:48.690 --> 07:53.210
Now they actually look way cleaner and more readable than the other HCM Ilja we had before.

07:53.280 --> 07:56.230
And this is really the power behind temple inheritance.

07:56.310 --> 07:58.290
So let's do this on another page.

07:59.270 --> 08:02.780
For example our home page which is index studies T.M..

08:02.780 --> 08:08.730
So again I can just get rid of all this other HTL code since that's already taken care of for me.

08:08.760 --> 08:19.980
I have doc type H T M L I need to extend from my actual base or a small file so I say extends that in

08:19.980 --> 08:25.030
quotes where it is under the template file which in this case it's basic app slash base.

08:25.060 --> 08:25.800
But each team L.

08:25.830 --> 08:28.410
So you can see you actually don't even need to call it baseline C.M..

08:28.410 --> 08:31.770
By convention it usually is called that but you could have named this whatever you wanted.

08:33.000 --> 08:37.650
Then again I pasan that body block.

08:37.690 --> 08:44.650
So here I call block body underscore block and the indentation is actually not necessary but it definitely

08:44.650 --> 08:45.690
helps with the readability.

08:45.700 --> 08:50.860
So I encourage you to try your best to try to keep formatted in readable code and then says welcome

08:50.860 --> 08:51.760
to index.

08:51.760 --> 08:59.250
And I'll say something like this is index that each T.M. page showing save that.

08:59.270 --> 09:08.930
And then we have that body block let's end the block so here we'll call and block save that and now

09:08.930 --> 09:11.400
it's actually run this and see what we get.

09:11.420 --> 09:15.140
So say Python managed up PI.

09:15.660 --> 09:18.830
We're on server and to make sure we didn't make any mistakes.

09:18.850 --> 09:19.260
OK.

09:19.300 --> 09:24.870
So I'm going to copy this and bring in over my browser and I can see here.

09:24.930 --> 09:30.210
I had this nice looking at bar and it says welcome to index index page html page showing.

09:30.270 --> 09:31.020
Perfect.

09:31.020 --> 09:33.510
Now let's check out the other page.

09:33.510 --> 09:38.820
So that was basic app slash other enter and out says welcome to other.

09:38.820 --> 09:43.130
This is an example of Temple inheritance SUNO here my web site looks really nice and clear.

09:43.140 --> 09:46.460
I have this nav bar showing across all the pages.

09:46.510 --> 09:49.580
But right now if I click on these links nothing's actually happening.

09:49.590 --> 09:54.750
Let's use the templates that we learned about in the previous lectures of the section to actually make

09:54.870 --> 09:56.730
these two different pages.

09:56.730 --> 09:58.280
So let's map brand to the home page.

09:58.320 --> 10:02.270
Adam into the admin page and then other to the other page.

10:02.340 --> 10:04.870
So we'll come back here and this is what we're going to do.

10:04.870 --> 10:08.640
We're going to come back to baseline age T.M. and appear where it's at.

10:08.700 --> 10:12.580
A riff on the brand abdomen and other will pasand those template tags.

10:12.580 --> 10:15.590
Those are all templates.

10:15.700 --> 10:20.890
So for the brand page will have the index one and this should feel just like review because we essentially

10:20.890 --> 10:24.640
already did all this in the relative your templates file.

10:24.760 --> 10:31.650
So say you are all here and then just pasand index as a single string for our home page then for Tref

10:31.720 --> 10:35.060
what I'm going to do is this links to the admin page.

10:35.110 --> 10:41.710
Remember I call your L and then admen colon index and Lumix for Helmick quotes in there.

10:41.850 --> 10:45.850
So this is all wrapped in single quotes member to be careful with spaces there.

10:47.650 --> 10:55.030
And then again we'll call your L and in this case this other page is under my basic app had a set that

10:55.130 --> 10:59.680
had a set that app name variable and then it's the name other.

10:59.710 --> 11:02.020
So let's save this.

11:02.020 --> 11:07.480
Bring back our browser and refresh it if I bring it in.

11:07.490 --> 11:12.590
Now I can click on the things to take me to brand take me to other and I can see as I'm clicking on

11:12.590 --> 11:18.260
it it's taking me and it really has the feel of a real Web site now where there's a nav bar that's taking

11:18.260 --> 11:23.080
me to all the pages across the Web site and is calling them using your old template tagging.

11:23.090 --> 11:25.790
And if I click on admin it's going to take me to the added and page.

11:25.790 --> 11:32.810
Now note that the nav bar goes away here because I didn't actually go into adman's h Tam l file and

11:32.840 --> 11:33.460
edit it.

11:33.530 --> 11:35.180
And honestly you shouldn't really be doing that.

11:35.180 --> 11:38.140
We'll talk about customizing the Django adamant interface.

11:38.150 --> 11:42.200
But as far as like styling of the abdomen and having a nav bar there that's really not necessary and

11:42.200 --> 11:45.200
that's not really the purpose of the jingo administration view.

11:45.470 --> 11:48.350
That's more for the ailing or for models but we'll talk about Django.

11:48.470 --> 11:51.350
Adam and customization and a feature section.

11:51.350 --> 11:51.860
OK.

11:51.980 --> 11:53.940
So that's really all we had to cover.

11:53.940 --> 11:58.490
Again the main thing to note here is you have a base that each team M-file always have this doctype

11:58.590 --> 12:04.040
HCM as the first line in your ace html files no matter if their base Steimle or their things that are

12:04.040 --> 12:05.910
extending that bassée smell.

12:06.020 --> 12:12.770
But then you have everything you want to be extended across all your pages outside of these two key

12:12.770 --> 12:13.240
tags.

12:13.280 --> 12:16.070
And that's the block body block and block.

12:16.280 --> 12:21.410
You can also have other blocks such as like a head block or whatever you want to call them.

12:21.550 --> 12:23.860
And then the relationship between base on each team.

12:23.980 --> 12:26.030
And the other pages is actually very clear.

12:26.030 --> 12:30.240
It's essentially just the reverse of one of the reliance on other Eastham mail you get rid of all the

12:30.370 --> 12:30.740
time.

12:30.760 --> 12:35.800
Besides the doctype you extend from whatever base that he's to himself file you want to reference.

12:35.920 --> 12:40.720
Then you call block in this case body block because you have body block here and then whatever you want

12:40.720 --> 12:45.690
inside of that and block and everything outside it's going to be extended just like the base e-mail

12:45.700 --> 12:46.470
here.

12:46.510 --> 12:50.740
Hopefully this is a pretty straightforward application of template inheritance.

12:50.740 --> 12:53.230
All right thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
