Hello everyone and welcome to the lecture on template inheritance.

00:08.910 --> 00:13.770
Let's learn how we can use Django template inheritance to practice dry coding principles dry standing

00:13.770 --> 00:14.040
for it.

00:14.040 --> 00:19.210
Don't repeat yourself template inheritance allows us to create a base template we can inherit from.

00:19.530 --> 00:24.450
Earlier we saw that we created a base that H team l file but left it blank in this lecture.

00:24.450 --> 00:26.700
We're going to explain what we're going to be using it for.

00:26.750 --> 00:32.530
And in the next lecture we'll actually code out through the example template inheritance saves us a

00:32.530 --> 00:37.360
lot of repetitive work and it makes it much easier to maintain the same base look and feel across our

00:37.360 --> 00:43.850
entire web site for example if we wanted a nav bar at the top of our page it wouldn't make sense to

00:43.850 --> 00:49.010
have to continually have the same nav bar ASTM Elco in each individual the HTL file.

00:49.130 --> 00:54.230
Before this lecture we used to have to have the same nav bar as HTML code over and over again if we

00:54.230 --> 00:57.530
wanted to extend it to every page in our Gengel project.

00:57.530 --> 01:01.760
Granted we haven't actually done that at all yet but we would have had to do that given what we know

01:01.760 --> 01:02.680
so far.

01:02.690 --> 01:08.240
So instead of doing that we can actually set it to the base h team l file and inherits it using template

01:08.240 --> 01:15.310
inheritance this idea is also sometimes known as template extending as an extending the base the HTL

01:15.320 --> 01:18.200
file to other aged him files.

01:18.200 --> 01:21.980
The inheritance doesn't need to just be limited to one base to each team file.

01:22.040 --> 01:23.620
You can extend multiple templates.

01:25.000 --> 01:26.710
Before you begin any Gengel project.

01:26.710 --> 01:30.330
It's always a good idea to sketch up the main idea organization by hand.

01:30.340 --> 01:33.910
This will help you realize what can be used for template inheritance and what applications you should

01:33.910 --> 01:39.360
create planning out your project in this manner will really give you a good idea of what code is going

01:39.360 --> 01:40.660
to be constantly reuse.

01:40.680 --> 01:42.140
So you can put that into your base.

01:42.180 --> 01:43.990
Each team El-Fadl.

01:44.130 --> 01:46.420
OK so what are the main steps for inheritance.

01:46.420 --> 01:47.570
Actually pretty simple.

01:47.590 --> 01:49.690
First you find the repetitive parts of your project.

01:49.690 --> 01:54.420
Things like now bar or a picture or a brand that you're going to see on most of the pages.

01:54.580 --> 01:59.000
Then you create a base template of those repetitive parts such as the nav bar.

01:59.200 --> 02:03.470
Then you set particular tags in the base template and also those tags and just the second.

02:03.730 --> 02:08.650
Once you've done that you extend and call those tags anywhere else in those other H.T. mail files that

02:08.650 --> 02:10.400
are not the base the HTML file.

02:11.220 --> 02:12.620
So what does it actually look like.

02:12.840 --> 02:16.460
Well on the left hand side we have that base to him file.

02:16.500 --> 02:21.270
This is the file it's going to have things like links to your javascript your assess your bootstrap

02:21.470 --> 02:27.390
a bunch of each team all things like nav bars etc. stuff that you want to inherit on to the other pages.

02:27.390 --> 02:33.030
Then inside the body stuff that you don't want on every single page you have these two main tags and

02:33.030 --> 02:35.780
that's the block tag with the name of the Block.

02:35.780 --> 02:39.340
In this case is the body block and then you have the end the block tag.

02:39.510 --> 02:41.090
Then you can have some more footer HTML.

02:41.100 --> 02:44.430
Outside of that and in that left hand side baste the HTML file.

02:44.430 --> 02:50.460
Basically what this is saying is everything outside of that is going to be inherited in the other file.

02:50.460 --> 02:55.230
So we can see here we have some other HTL file and we want to make sure that the first line is always

02:55.260 --> 03:02.920
doctype h T.M. after that you can call the extends and then actually call the path to your base studies

03:02.960 --> 03:08.220
to metafile and then after that you call block body underscore or block that matches the name of your

03:08.220 --> 03:14.340
baseless email file and then you have your HTL that's specific to this other that each team file stuff

03:14.340 --> 03:16.220
that wasn't in the base then each team l.

03:16.290 --> 03:20.730
Then once you're done with that you call and block so you can see it's kind of the reverse or opposite

03:21.570 --> 03:26.430
on the left hand side you see everything outside of that is going to be passed in when we extend that

03:26.520 --> 03:30.780
to the right hand side and on the right hand side everything in sight close by the box is going to be

03:31.200 --> 03:36.850
put into the base sites female or extended with the base that it's Steimle.

03:37.290 --> 03:38.160
OK.

03:38.160 --> 03:41.290
So let's actually walk through a basic example of this temple inheritance.

03:41.340 --> 03:46.320
It's actually a really easy and smooth process and once you start using temple inheritance is actually

03:46.320 --> 03:50.970
going to make it much easier to read HTL files across your web page because you're going to get rid

03:50.970 --> 03:52.810
of all this junk repetitive code.

03:52.860 --> 03:55.450
And after that we'll all go to your base sites HTML file.

03:55.620 --> 03:57.870
OK thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
