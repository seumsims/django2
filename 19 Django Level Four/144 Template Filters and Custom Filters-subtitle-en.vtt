Hello everyone and welcome to the templates features and filter's lecture before we complete jingle

00:10.150 --> 00:12.350
level 4 in our understanding of templates.

00:12.460 --> 00:18.430
Let's quickly touch upon Django template filter's imagine that you had some information from your model

00:18.640 --> 00:23.590
that you wish to use across various views or pages on your website but perhaps you wanted to make a

00:23.590 --> 00:28.630
slight edit to the information before injecting it maybe like a string operation or basic arithmetic

00:29.080 --> 00:34.390
for example maybe on a certain web page you wanted the string to be all capital letters but on another

00:34.390 --> 00:36.640
web page you just want to be in lowercase.

00:36.640 --> 00:42.170
Well how do you actually deal if that luckily Gengel provides a ton of easy to implement template filters

00:42.500 --> 00:45.980
that allow you to affect the injection before the splaying it to the user.

00:45.980 --> 00:48.490
And this allows for flexibility from a single source.

00:48.590 --> 00:51.530
So you don't have to worry about editing the source on the Python side.

00:51.530 --> 00:55.420
You can actually edit it using templates on the Web site.

00:55.540 --> 00:58.890
So the general form of a template filter it looks like this.

00:58.930 --> 01:04.570
Previously we just had those set of brackets and then the value we wanted to inject here we can say

01:04.570 --> 01:09.880
the value you want to inject have the pipe operator that straightline the name of the filter and then

01:09.880 --> 01:11.840
the parameter that the filter takes in.

01:11.860 --> 01:16.120
Now not all filters taken parameters and we'll see examples of them as we continue on throughout this

01:16.120 --> 01:16.920
section.

01:17.230 --> 01:20.620
Many of these filters are based off of common built in Python functions.

01:20.620 --> 01:22.350
So you're already going to be familiar with them.

01:22.360 --> 01:25.340
They're naming operations and what they can actually do.

01:25.750 --> 01:30.250
OK let's show you the documentation on them so you know how to reference all the various filters.

01:30.250 --> 01:31.170
There are a ton of them.

01:31.270 --> 01:35.230
So a lot of times will just be go into documentation seeing which one you need to use and then copying

01:35.230 --> 01:38.730
and pasting from there later on will also show you how you create your own filters.

01:39.720 --> 01:41.520
I'm going to jump to documentation.

01:41.520 --> 01:42.890
You can go to this specific link.

01:42.900 --> 01:46.550
This is the documentation link for templates for 1.1 0.

01:46.560 --> 01:50.610
This version of Django or you can just google search Gengel plus templates and it'll probably take you

01:50.610 --> 01:53.090
to this page and hop over there now.

01:53.100 --> 01:58.400
All right so here we are at the documentation page for Django templates and this is a really great reference

01:58.410 --> 02:00.410
if you ever have any questions on templates.

02:00.510 --> 02:04.070
And as I always mentioned the jayega documentation in general is really good.

02:04.170 --> 02:08.740
So the templates page it starts off by talking about different support for template engines.

02:08.790 --> 02:11.620
By default we use the Django template language or DTL.

02:11.640 --> 02:13.580
It's more than enough for our use cases.

02:13.590 --> 02:17.880
So if you're just learning Django as you get more advance you can always check out popular alternatives

02:17.880 --> 02:20.060
for template engines such as Jinja too.

02:20.190 --> 02:23.280
And this tells you how to connect them how to download them etc..

02:23.490 --> 02:25.590
So a lot of really useful information here.

02:25.620 --> 02:28.590
But we're going to be concerned about is template filters.

02:28.650 --> 02:33.280
So if you come over here on the right hand side there should be a link under syntax to filters.

02:33.330 --> 02:37.030
You can click on it and it will show you what filters look like.

02:37.080 --> 02:42.600
So as I mentioned in general look like this I'm going to zoom in a little bit here to see the filters

02:43.050 --> 02:44.370
Museum and one more time.

02:44.460 --> 02:47.340
Scroll back down to the filters.

02:47.340 --> 02:48.260
And here there.

02:48.480 --> 02:48.970
OK.

02:49.290 --> 02:51.510
So the filters in general look like this.

02:51.510 --> 02:57.190
Remember we have a context dictionary that is actually calling a key value pair.

02:57.270 --> 03:01.560
And then we pass in the key here that's the actual variable or value we're passing in.

03:01.680 --> 03:06.240
Then you have the pipe operator and the name of the filter you want to apply.

03:06.240 --> 03:11.520
So in this case we have Django where the context of jingle being the key and it's attached to the string

03:11.550 --> 03:16.920
that's in all lower case and then the filter name we're using is called Title and title if you're familiar

03:16.920 --> 03:22.380
with Python string operations it's also a python string operation where it basically capitalizes the

03:22.380 --> 03:24.590
first letter and every word in a string.

03:24.750 --> 03:27.900
So you can see how converts this to this right here.

03:27.960 --> 03:32.340
And as I mentioned some filters also take an argument or a parameter and that would look like something

03:32.340 --> 03:35.990
like this you would say my date that belongs to some context dictionary.

03:36.090 --> 03:41.810
The pipe operator and then the name of the filter date's colon and in a string whatever argument you're

03:41.820 --> 03:47.100
actually passing in this case the format of the date you want to display and there's a reference for

03:47.100 --> 03:50.880
all the built in filters as well as instructions for writing your own custom filters.

03:50.880 --> 03:55.230
Now there are so many built in filters that we don't have enough time in this course to go through them

03:55.230 --> 03:55.710
all.

03:55.740 --> 03:59.100
Really what you're going to be doing is clicking on this link and referencing them yourself.

03:59.280 --> 04:04.170
But there's also a way to write your own custom filters which will also show you how to do in a future

04:04.170 --> 04:04.730
election.

04:04.860 --> 04:06.680
But that's all we're going to cover for now.

04:06.750 --> 04:12.420
In this lecture coming up next we're going to talk about just some few examples of basic built in filters

04:12.480 --> 04:15.510
as well as talking about how to create your own custom filters.

04:15.510 --> 04:17.190
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
